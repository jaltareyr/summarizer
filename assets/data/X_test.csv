0,"Summarize: i bought two of these hats to keep on our son's boat. they are pretty stylish but most importantly does protect my hair and face from the sun. love the upf protection. the only nominally downside is it is difficult to stay on when the boat is going fast. i think for wear at the beach or just outside it is a great purchase. i needed something for my cruise to hawaii. i ordered this atthe last moment, but amazon came through and i <UNK> the day before i left. i love the look, the feel, the factthat i can fold it and stick it in my suitcase and, best of all, i received compliments on it. i looked at a few sizing charts and they said that 'one size fits all' will fit a head with a circumference of 21 1 / 2 '- 22 1 / 4'. my head is 21 3 / 4 'and this hat sat on the top of my ears! i have returned it. i wear a hat anytime i am outside for any length of time. this hat is cute and provides great sun protection. i have a hat for hiking and a hat for the beach, but this is for more dressy occasions like an outdoor birthday party or a trip to butterfly world with my granddaughter. good quality hat, i love that i can be protected from the sun, and look good too! i'd also like to commend customer service, which was responsive and helpful when i accidentally shipped my order to the wrong address. i have already ordered another hat for my daughter. i spent 2 months at the beach this summer and this hat was great. it kept my head cool even in nearly 100 degree weather and also kept my face protected. i have a fairly large head and had no problem with the one size fits all. loved the stitching design, got a lot of compliements on it. the best part is you can roll it up and pack in your suitcase for travel and it unfolds beautifully. provides the right amount of coverage and stayed on my head in windy conditions. it looks good; it's comfortable; it keeps the sun off my face & neck. i wear it while gardening or for walks. i got it in the moss green and the color is as shown online. i'm glad i bought it."
1,"Summarize: i bought this tank to wear under shirts when it is colder out. i bought one in white and one in an aqua blue color. they are long enough that the color peeks out from under my tops. looks cute. i do wish that the neck line was a bit higher cut to provide more modest coverage of my chest. i usually get them someplace out but they no longer carry them. i thought i would give these a try. i received them fast, although i did order a brown and got a black (which i also needed a black anyway). they were a lot thinner than i like but they are okay. every women should own one in every color. they wash well perfect under everything. perfect alone. as i write i'm waiting on another of the same style to arrive. just feels quality i don't know how else to explain it, but i'm sure you get it ladies! i'm 5 '4' and this tank fits like a normal tank top, not any longer. i was trying to find a tank that would cover past my hips, so i could wear it with leggings. don't order if you're expecting tunic length. this shirt is ok if you are layering for sure. it is thin and runs small. i usually wear a small and read the reviews and ordered a medium. it fits tight and is not long like in the picture. glad i only purchased one. the only reason i'm rating this at two stars is because it is listed as a 'long' tank top and the photo even shows it going well past the models hips, however i'm short and the tank top is just a normal length. the description say it long... not so it is average. that's why i purchased it because it said it was long. this is a basic tank.i washed it and it didn't warp but did shrink a little. nothing to brag about. the tank fit very well and was comfortbale to wear. the material was thinner than i expected, and i felt it was probably a little over priced. i've bought much higher quality tanks for $5 at a local store."
2,"Summarize: the color is great. just what i wanted for my kitchen <UNK>. one thing, i rated 4 stars because i find it difficult to open the lid... it's really tough. it's tight. after a few day it has gotten better. i think it'll keep getting easier. besides that one flaw i like it. the kettle is beautiful, but within 5 uses the handle started melting. apparently the handle is plastic and cannot withstand hot temperatures, which is unfortunate for a product that must hold boiling water. you can buy this kettle if you don't plan on using it. you've been warned! ! i ordered this as a gift because the color is shown as a light turquoise, which i wanted. the color is actually a very dark turquoise, could have bought the same color in target for less money... the teapot itself is very nice.. may be sending it back though it's lovely. no cracking or loss of enamel. it is just the right color. sadly it is a little smaller than i expected (smaller than the average tea kettle) makes for small batches of tea. quite happy with it though. this teapot works well for me, sometimes i wish it had a whistle. the color appears as shown. remember to use it on low / medium heat. at first the top is a little difficult to remove but now it works well. as a tea pot it works fine but the handle is plastic & the cover has repainted & chipped paint at the base of the <UNK> am not happy with the product but because of my health & price, i did not send it back. perfect for our <UNK> condo in florida style - bought all our kitchen accessories to go with it.no problems, but i do intend to drain all the water out after using and not let any sit overnight in the pot to prevent rust. be warned - the color of this cute little kettle as depicted in this ad is not at all what arrives when you order it. it's more of a medium, dusty sky blue. not in any way 'turquoise.'"
3,"Summarize: exactly as described, at 8 + oz. of solid metal this grip offers a stable way to hold your lightweight digital camera, without putting you fingers in front of the lens or flash. i find it works well with the kodak <UNK> video camera and the nikon s9100 point and <UNK> <UNK> pistol handgrip stabilizer for point-n-shoot, dslr and video cameras a low cost device that i bought and paired with a cell phone reduce jittery videos. works pretty well for handheld use even when walking. the thread seemed a little recessed at first until i moved the washer flat. i recommend this product for anyone who records videos often for friends, and family especially with your cell phone. i was planning to use this with my d7000 + battery grip + 80-200 f / 2.8 lens, but when i received it, i changed my mind.it just does not look like it can handle that load. i put it on my panasonic gf2, and it performs very <UNK> highly recommend it for lighter cameras. bought this as part of the stabilizer rig then realized that this was easier to use alone than the rig itself. i am going to use it with a camera with an active stabilizer. videos looked good. will update after i use it this weekend. it looks good and is built solid. the unit is quite sturdy. i bought it to replace the pistol grip unit also featured because the pistol grip locking mechanism did seem to want to lock tight. this unit locks in very tightly and also feels professional. a great purchase for the money. this is the 2nd stabilizer that i've purchased... one for my sony a99 and one for my sony a33. i can't speak highly enough about this handy little item! it's perfectly sized and the ergonomics is ideal! two thumbs up! ! probably the best and the least expensive stick i've ever owned and i love it.i use this with my gopro hd hero2. it's a bit heavy but the construct is very good. you can use this as a weapon too. lol i use this with a <UNK> mount and i like this because of the heft / weight and it stays pretty secure whether i use it with the mount or on my flip video camera or snapshot. i'd recommend this handle highly."
4,"Summarize: i could not have been more disappointed in my purchase! the picture and size was perfect but there were so many wrinkles it looked terrible. i took it to a professional <UNK> and even using there equipment the wrinkles remained. when i bought the poster it was supposed to be brand new. i was really ripped off and may never order from amazon again. this poster is a few years out of date - still lists pluto as a planet - but man, the artwork on it is awesome. i also love the inset map that shows the planets' sizes to scale. it's probably not good for a classroom due to its age, but for a bedroom or general decoration, it's great. i spent an hour looking for a solar system poster that included pluto. my son insists it is unfair that pluto was' fired '. it includes information on conditions, atmosphere, diameter, and the duration of each planets' day 'and' year '. it covered all the basic information we needed, and it is beautiful. pretty happy with the poster for something to teach my son when he grows up about just how small our world actually is compared to the other planets that are out <UNK> good quality and looks pretty good up on the <UNK> enough to catch someones eye and clear enough to tell which planet is which. its a great poster! bought at a huge discount. only thing is i thought the description said laminated. it was not, its a standard poster. but its perfect for what i needed it for. now i just have to get a frame for it: d it's a bit dated, and if your not sitting directly by it, it's a bit hard to read. the poster is nice though. we didn't get a frame just hung it on the wall for homeschooling, we like it a lot! my son said 'wow, this is great!' he's only 4 years but he's enjoying learning about the solar system. each planet has an informative summary. great service! will be framing the poster for his room. love it! ! the item arrived on time and my son loves it. it's posted on the side wall next to his bed. he looks at it all the time. the picture quality is not perfect but for the price it's okay."
5,"Summarize: i bought this purse and was worried it wouldnt come as it said in the ad. when it arrived at my home i was more than extatic when i saw how nice it was. i am actually very impressed by this purse, and reccomend it to any one looking to spice up there out fit. looks great with boots and leggings! i chose it because it's a beautiful purse, but too many straps (4) they come off, but then the connecter is still visible. i had to return it, i couldn't even see a way to have my leather person doctor it up without ruining the beauty of it. i was all about this bag and then when ups brought it i was not to happy, the bag is way to small the straps are to short and one of the straps was <UNK> i will b e returning or give it to my daughter to play with. love this! pretty size: not to big? not to small, color and shape! and very flashy. everyone loves it! all the stones were on it when it arrived at my house and only one fell off as i was trying it out! i like the purse, but you definitely can't carry it often because the stones fall off a lot. its a decent size snd the material is a decent quality. i would love the purse if the stones didn't fall off. i have had this purse less than a month and now all 3 straps broke!!!! worst quality ever!!!!! had to throw it away!! 40 $(after shipping) down the toilet! ! the bag is a lot smaller than it appears, i though i could fit my school books in it but i definitely cannot. however it's a really cute bag and i will still get a lot of use out of it. i hate this bag! it's horrible, it's the worst bag i've ever got! it broke the first day i got it and didn't even carry it! it's definitely not the size i thought it was!"
6,"Summarize: i don't believe these shoes will fit anyone who wears a narrow. if i order my true size, they're too short and my toes hit the front of the shoe yet if i order the next size up they're too wide yet my toes still hit in the same place. both pairs went back -- bummer! the shoe is so comfortable and i bought another 'walking' shoe by ahnu which is perfect <UNK> a cute and comfy shoe to do lots of walking in europe this spring. these will fit the bill.i found this style was a little big so i had to get a half size smaller and it is <UNK> reviews said to buy a size smaller. i wear a 7 so ordered the 6.5. it was still too big, and i'm guessing a 6 would fit. i bought the ahnu sandal at 6.5 and it fit perfectly. i plan to reorder the shoe but in a size 6. i would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a very comfortable walking shoe with some style. i can wear these instead of sneakers for less casual events. the shoes run big. i normally wear a 7 1 / 2, but ended up with the 7 which fit just right. i always take a 7 or 7.5, in fact own a pair of flipflops from this brand in a 7, decided to order 7.5 and it fits more like a 8.5 or even a 9. way too large. am returning & hope to replace with a smaller size. i ordered these shoes in a half size smaller than my regular size due to reviews that i read, but they were still too small. they were pretty shoes, so was very disappointed. the company was very good about refunding my money very quickly. fit as expected. have trouble with my feet: neuromas, plantar fasciitis, and bunion. looking for comfortable cushioned for quick trips to run errands without putting on sneakers and sneakers. these work great for me but not for all day use. i am in and out of areas where the footing can be slippery. i wanted a cute but totally functional shoe and this is it. incredibly lightweight! i bet i could run in these. great all around casual working shoe."
7,"Summarize: this case fits perfectly on my 14inch hp. i disagree with the comments that talk about the smell being terrible. the smell really wasn't that strong and went away after a couple of weeks. i love the design and it was a fair price. shipping was a little expensive though. it arrived quickly and i would buy from this seller again. this was bought for our teen daughter for christmas, the only negative things about it are <UNK> strap <UNK> pockets, other than that it is great, but in all fairness i knew both things about it when ordered, it came in very fast, was just as described, great item for the price. i have a dell inspiron 14, and the cover is a little snug. it's working well though and now i can carry my laptop in my school backpack rather than carry a separate laptop bag. i'd recommend this product, just do a bunch of research to make sure it will fit. i bought it for my acer 14 ', it is a little bit tight, but the worst was it has heavy rubber smell, when i leave the case in my room, the rubber smell was filled with the air everywhere of my room, made me sick. don't buy it. i like this case very much! it fits my acer aspire 14 'as a glove!!! yes, it smells a little bit but i wouldn't say that it's so bad as mentioned in some reviews. and it's very cute too. i recommend this product to anyone. love the design of this sleeve. when i don't have a table i use the sleeve as a mat to protect my thighs from the heat of my laptop. wish it had a bit more padding and cushion but other than that it's a pretty carrying sleeve. i really love it! it doesn't smell a lot as some reviews say and the draw is well <UNK> bought this size for a 13.3 'because my laptop will have a cover on it so i don't know how it fits for a traditional 14 inch, i really enjoy the design of this case but i thought it would be lighter. when it came, it was a very dark grey which was a bummer. but the quality is good and it has a nice thick padding to protect my laptop."
8,"Summarize: if you're looking for just a heart rate monitor (it is waterproof and good for swimming) then this is for you. there aren't any bells and whistles at all. straight forward, heart rate, time of exercise and that's it. the log only stores your last workouts data, you need to record it before you start another session. this is a good monitor if you have no need for the fancy training models. beginner or <UNK> runners should stick to basic types like this. the polar monitors i have had like this are well-made and easy to use and this is no exception. i am coming off a long <UNK> and plan to use this to work back into shape without risking <UNK>. i ordered and polar <UNK> and it was confirmed after the order was processed. when i got the email for confirmation, it said <UNK>. they did the old bait and switch on me! i immediately returned it and very upset with the order after going through a long process of doing research for a hrm. very dissatisfied! i was disapointed to find the booklet with it didn't help with any instructions on use. but after checking the manual on the internet i was able to set it up and use it. it is much easier than others i have purchased. this is what i was looking for. ease of use. i bought this monitor as a newcomer to heart rate monitors. it is easy to use right out of the box and makes working out more enjoyable - you can make sure that you are working hard enough to improve, but not too hard. very good value. extremely easy to use, only one button. seems to be fairly accurate. has a backlight and can beep to warn you if you fall out of a target heart range that is completely programmable. however, the battery is not replaceable and the screen scratches easily. it's my first heart rate monitor. very useful. i always run with it to control my pace. the problem is when i run more then 1 hour because i don't see the seconds as it has only 4 digits on the display. this was very well-rated on consumer reports. i really like that you can plug in your target heart rate, and it has an audible alert to let you know when you're there. the display is easy to read and it's light-weight."
9,"Summarize: my husband takes 4 per day - i take 2. the price on <UNK> & save is good. the product is consistant high quality, delivered same time each month and i don't have to go to the store to find the shelf empty. product is worth the purchase. i know i will get the same product every month and its a good product well, i've taken the first softgel capsule and given it enough time now and i can say it is, indeed, truly burp-less, unlike certain other fish oil products i've tried that shall remain nameless. if i pass away due to coronary disease, i'll consider lowering my rating of it but i'll still have appreciated its <UNK>. if you are like me i like sushi but i couldnt stand the constant taste of it when i was taking regular fish oil and krill oil pills, this is why i stopped taking them. the directions said to drink a lot of water when taking them and i did but it didnt matter. i love this fish oil it does what it says.. i have been using nature made products for years. i feel amazon offers them at a great price. these fish oil caps are the burp less variety which i would recommend to others if you take fish oil daily as i do. i would order them again. also received them within a few days. these are a good value, but they're not burp-less. they tend to make me burp for up to an hour or two after taking them. i don't like fish, so i was terrified of fish burps, but they're actually not terrible and don't taste very 'fishy.' for anyone like myself who uses omega 3 fish oil on a regular basis, i recommend this product. this is the burp-less version which leaves no after taste in your mouth and is easily swallowed with a small amount of liquid. stay heart healthy and take omega 3 daily. i've tried the nature made original fish oil before and i didn't like the fishy smell and sometimes bad burp after taste... but this burp-less version is really better as i haven't burped and it has no fishy smell... i'm switching to this one permanently.. i couldn't handle the burping up of fish smell that other fish oil gels came with. and preferred not to use the liquid version. this gel is great. i been using it for months <UNK> not one burp! :)"
10,"Summarize: i love these protein bars in the vanilla flavor. they taste like rice krispies treats with vanilla frosting. i can't believe they are actually 'good' for you. i usually try to stay away from processed foods, but these are my guilty pleasure -- i eat them for dessert all the time. i like them much better than the chocolate nugo bars. i find these a little chewy (my jaw gets tired towards the very end), but that could just be me. i love these. i think the flavor is good. they keep me feeling fuller longer than other brands that i've had. my work has them and i loved them so much i ended up coming here to get a whole box. i love this flavor of nugo bars. not many grocery stores carry it, so when they do i buy all they have on the shelves. when i am out of them i have to order them online. i always keep one or two in my purse for when i am out and hungry and don't care to buy junk food. i tried these for the first time at work, and loved them. but they sell them for $<UNK> a bar! and even though they are totally worth it, i wanted to purchase my own box. my kids even got to try them and they really like them too! i will be ordering two boxes next time around! nugo bars are great for breakfast, lunch or a snack. i keep them in my desk at work and my husband keeps them in his car. eat them with a tall glass of water and they will keep you satisfied for hours. they are <UNK> and taste great. i'm so glad i can order these from amazon! love the bar, love the taste, love the 170 calories... love it, my husband and son love it <UNK> eat way too many of them but i dont feel guilty as it is a great and healthy snack on the go!! this one is my favorite of all! very good! we all eat these and other bars in our house for meal replacements. these are one of their favorites but they are very sweet! in comparison, there are bars that have better ingredients but this one is good! they remind me of rice krispy treats! apart from the obvious nutritional value, the taste was surprisingly better than i anticipated. normally, if i find <UNK> nutritional bars tend to have a chalky or <UNK> texture and taste. i dare say, the texture reminds me of a <UNK> 'rice krispy treat'."
11,"Summarize: works well, a little small thou. i usually get the biggest roaster chicken i can find (usually <UNK>) but this seems a little small for that size chicken (5 - 6lbs would fit better). however, love the drip pan feature, it collects all the juices so you can baste! for the price, i would definately recomend it! this is a perfect substitute for doing rotisserie chicken in the winter when the barbie won't heat up to temp. i use two of them at the same time to put two chickens in the oven at 475 degrees coated with sams rotisserie rub and it turns out perfect every time... no beer can needed- the chickens stay moist on there own. five stars for the collapsible design. it holds a normal size beer can but not a bottle. i only use it as a stand (humidity is irrelevant for a char-broil infrared cooker), and it is very solid. goes right on the rack or grill without any fear of tipping, and holds a large chicken. my husband and i use this all the time to cook whole chickens now. we don't bother putting a beer can in it. i've used it several times on the grill as well as in the oven. the chicken comes out perfectly cooked and the skin nice and crispy every time! this worked okay, but it didn't make much change for our grilling. i thought my husband would love it, but he was pretty <UNK>... and we've only used it once - as it's a bit cumbersome. so, i guess it's okay but not 'necessary.' very easy to use and loved the way the chicken cooked. just another great way of cooking on your grill without worrying about having to turn it around. you put it on your grill and go do your side dishes while your chicken is done. i like the pan under the chicken to catch the drippings, but it is awful tall. even using the bottom rack of my oven the chicken almost touches the <UNK> no way it would fit in our <UNK> it really makes great tasting chicken! ! i had in the past bought and a chicken roaster in south africa but i now cannot find anyone who sells them. i went on to amazon and found this product and i have received them and am very happy with my purchase."
12,"Summarize: amazon ought to be ashamed to carry this junk on their line-up. you got enough bad reviews to open your <UNK> reading the murdered english in their manual is enough to tell you this is made by <UNK>. just try <UNK> to your station on the fm - hopeless. the noisy constant fan! the unreal low price should have been a <UNK>! charles i did not go wrong when i purchased this stereo receiver. tons of power pushing my system, what an upgrade from my old one, this is a real powerhouse. it pounds. remote control, quality crafted stereo receiver for under a hundred bucks! i thought it would be good, but did not expect this. a sweet deal! if you want just a stereo then this will do the manual is very limited. the fan is loud and the usb player will only let you go one track at a time so if you have a 100 tracks it will take time to get there. the sound is fine and is easy to connect up. first problem i have with this receiver is you can't set the channel presets. also the speaker wire terminals are not clamps and it took me a while to screw them in. the power is good and it looks durable. i don't believe you can play the tv's sound through the receiver. i got this to replace a 20 year old stereo i had. i went by the speaker specifications when i purchased this one. when i hooked it up, this receiver pushed my 15's more than i ever heard before without messing them up. perfection!! i recommend this to everyone! this amp is very inexpensive and its performance proves its quality. first, you can't play a turntable without buying a preamp. that would be ok if the sound reproduction was good. i would have settled for good. i didn't settle and returned it; you shouldn't either. this sound system is worth all the money you pay for it iv never heard bass so clear and ass loud as its going tough my 12 '' and 8 '' and two 5 '' subwoofers buy this if your looking for grate sound. the stereo works fantastic as amp. for laptop or mp3 player. radio reception is poor. has great range of sound adjustment. i have it in my garage, with speakers all around. use mostly for sirius / xm radio on laptop."
13,"Summarize: we've used these filters in our dustbuster for several years. with a little care, such as occasionally blowing it out with air or tapping on sidewalk, they have very long life. seem to catch everything from grit, to dog hair, to fine ashes without letting much blow through exhaust. getting harder to find at local stores, so i bought two. i was disappointed to discover that the filter does not fit the black and decker dustbuster i own. there are nubs around the top that prevent it from working. i have not been able by number or description to locate the proper filter or amazon or anywhere else. this is very disappointing as i purchased the vacuum on amazon. i bought this to replace my tired and dirty filter. after i received it, i realized that there was nothing wrong with the one i already had. (they are washable.) however it helps to have two, so you can change the filter quickly when necessary and not take time to wash the first one. this is the wrong filter if you are buying the <UNK> hand vacuum. amazon pairs it up together and it says it works with all 'cyclonic hand vacs,' but it doesn't. you need the <UNK> for the <UNK>. amazon wrong. product description wrong. me wrong for not reading the reviews first. instead of having to buy an all new dustbuster just because mine is older and the filters aren't in stock anywhere didn't mean i had to <UNK> & pay for a newer one. after having found the filters here, i buy them and they work extremely well. very satisfied. i bought the cordless cyclonic dustbuster <UNK>. the correct filter for the dustbuster <UNK> is replacement filter <UNK>. in the 'frequently bought together' section at amazon, both the <UNK> replacement filter and the <UNK> replacement filter are listed. the <UNK> replacement filter will not fit the <UNK>. this item list listed with the vacuum -- 'frequently bought together' with the black & decker <UNK> 9.6 volt <UNK> cordless dustbuster but this filter does not fit! argh! corrections are needed in the 'frequently bought together' section, and the correct filter needs to be listed. i bought these filters because it said they are often bought with the vaccum i got. recently, i went to put them in the vaccum and discovered they do not fit. to boot, i missed the window to get a refund. rip off!"
14,"Summarize: i have had a ton a problems with these discs. after about 30 minutes of a dvd, it begins to get choppy and become unviewable. looking at the burn side of the disc, there is a area where you can see the burning stopped and i guess picked again. do not recommend. the box was too big and allow the spindle to bounce around in box and plastic covering spindle which keeps the blank dvd in place was broken and dvd were off the spindle. if that is the only size boxes have should put more packing so it will not allow spindle to move at all. yes, hp dvd's are dvd's for the better. better price. better quality. i have used these over the years for many different projects and the quality is there and so is the price. i have had trouble with some other brand named dvd's, but not with hp. vendor describes the product as being gold in color. it is not it is silver. i know that hp no longer manufactures the gold <UNK> was hoping this vendor had some gold version of dvd + r in it inventory. they need change the picture and description to silver instead of gold. been purchasing only hp dvd + r media for 8 years or more. always got the hp branded gold coated. made by cmc, with id of <UNK>. this batch is not gold as portrayed in the photo, it's silver coated, but still the same id. produces about 25% coasters, and another 10-15% that won't play on dvd players. the first half was about what i expected, a few coasters, a couple minor errors. the second half i was lucky to get maybe 5 that worked flawlessly. no good! ive always bought the hp dvd + r 100 pk and find that they go a long way, seldom do i find a coaster in the pack... <UNK> his was my first time purchasing the 100 pk from amazon, but so far so good. after receiving this dvd + r, i think i should order the 50 piece spindle. i did not burn too often. i believe it is enough for 2 years. i tried a couple of discs, anyway, like it."

16,"Summarize: i recently bought this film and slide scanner to scan my grandfather's slide collection. it bleaches out the image with too much light. i tried changing the settings to improve the image quality, but had no luck. the company arcsoft charges $10.00 per phone call for tech support. you are better off making the investment on a nicer quality scanner. * * not reccommended * * purchased as a gift in august. opened a week ago. spent the last week trying to get win xp to recognise the vu point scanner. many drivers and reloads later all i have is a little black box with a red light and a message from windows that says' usb device not recognised '. i found the <UNK> scanner not acceptable and i am still waiting for a replacement. my contacts with <UNK> were helpful but the equipment still did not produce acceptable images. my contact with the seller has been sporadic, at best, and a replacement unit has not been delivered.i an not anxious to deal with these providers again. its not worth the time it takes to get the negative to fit in the holders they give you. i'd much rather buy a hp flat bed scanner that lets you see the final photo image and not just an image of the negative. it takes to much time and isn't worth the money. while the software was good for windows xp and vista, i now have windows 7 and would like to have software for the newer operating system. the company prefers to sell other products rather than update their software. i can't see recommending this product in today's market. product is very easy to use. does a great job converting my slide and photo negatives to digital format. touch-up and enhance program gave me just what i needed to clean up and enhance some of the scans, company was great to work with! ! i used the <UNK> digital scanner to scan over 1,200 35 mm negatives and about a dozen slides and found this gadget a most user-friendly and efficient tool. i even managed to upload a few black and white negatives from 1963. i recommend the product highly. while most equipment will work with more modern versions of windows than were available when manufactured this is not true with this scanner. requires windows xp means it won't work with earlier or later. its on its way back for a refund."
17,"Summarize: these insoles are so thin that i can even wear them in my pumps. they look so much nicer than <UNK> and work way better too. i highly recommend them. i accidentally ordered a men's 9 instead of a women's 9. it was huge but very easy to trim down with scissors. enjoy! i love this product... 100% natural and eliminates foot odor! while it appeared to be smaller than my 8.5 shoes, the insole fits perfectly into heels, boots, flats and running shoes. very impressed! it has worked wonders so far! can't wait to put this product to test this summer! product is ok. it doesn't seem to work as well for me as was advertised. it does serve to keep your show a little dryer, but doesn't seem to work all day for me. i wouldn't recommend it as there are other options that do the same but cost <UNK> this is a fantastic product that i would recommend to anyone who wants their feet to feel cooler, more comfortable, less sweaty and ultimately less smelly! they are so effective i use them in several pairs of shoes. i'm a very happy customer, thanks so much <UNK>! i have thick peeling, itchy skin on the bottom of one foot. i had tried everything to get rid of it. the final trick were these inserts along with slathering coconut oil mixed with athletes foot oil & oregano oil two times a day. finally, normal soft feet! got these for my 9-year-old who has really bad foot odor. i really had little confidence that these would work but needed to try <UNK> anything- to help. and lo and behold they actually work. so well that i ordered another set for a second pair of shoes. im sure if i were to put them in my tennis shoes they would probably fit perfectly. i am wearing them in my croc i have to wear for work. thay are to thin width wise to really make a difference bc they tend to slide around. the insoles fit comfortably into my shoes. i love that they are discreet and thin. i no longer have to worry about foot odor or about my shoes stinking. i definitely can see where my shoes will have a longer life by using these insoles."

19,"Summarize: i got this because it was a deal. i should've known tomtom has a funny way of making you forced to update maps, and in la a lot of stuff changes so you may as well not even bother with this thing. i use this now as a back-up gps. i just hope this thing does find if and when my phone dies. basic gps unit for those of an older age who do not use smart phones. the screen is small but for the price, a very nice unit. touch screen and color graphics are a nice touch. if you are looking for the no frills, basic navigation system, save $50 + and buy the 'one'. i got this for my granddaughter for christmas and she is thrilled with it. she has her own business and must do a lot of traveling, this has been a great help to her in her travels. she is very pleased with it and i am so glad i got this for her gift. i have purchased this nit back in 2011 and after couple month the battery kept <UNK> researching this problem, it appears there is a known bug that the gps wakes up by itself and drains all <UNK> firmware update ever resolved it.avoid, not recommending, seems like a widely known issue. i got a great deal on this tomtom. not the latest technology (screen size, touch screen / talk options) but had all the features i needed (full street names big visuals). it hasn't dissappointed yet! i would recommended this to anyone. works great. easy to use. sometimes may try to take you on a weird route. still have to have an idea of how you want to get somewhere so that doesnt happen. but, it will always get you to where you want to go. very easy to set up and use! arrived about 2 days sooner than expected. i didn't even have to read the manual to figure out how to use it. i also like the speedometer on it (my car's speedometer isn't working). i'm a novice at electronics, and there are too many processes to go thru to get to what you want (to get to your destination) - once you figure out all of the buttons to push - it's a beautiful thing..."

21,"Summarize: what else can be said..... this product is revolutionary. i cannot believe something so simple could be so effective and i wonder why i didn't see this myself! kudos to the inventor. this magnet is strong and putting your glasses through the space while working is easy and just as easy to retrieve them when needed. necessity is the mother of invention.... these little guys are amazing,, the magnetic is very strong,, your glasses will not fall out when bending over.. yeah maybe a crystal does fall out so what,, just glue it back in and it stays,, you'll always know where your glasses are,, love mine readerest eye-glass <UNK> broke off after one week and i have no phone number to call the company. for the week i had it, it worked fine on my shirt but one of the front round magnets <UNK> from the glass holding piece. a piece of junk! i wish i could use this, but my <UNK> said no.... even though i have a fairly new, <UNK> pacemaker. he doesn't have any problem with me having a cell phone in my shirt pocket, but said this magnet is just too powerful. i saw this product on shark tank and wanted it then. when i ordered it and tried it i was very impressed. the magnet is super strong and you can place it anywhere on your clothing. i bought 2 and will order more for christmas <UNK> fantastic product! ive had to order more now that ive shown to everyone. they all want one. can be placed anywhere on your clothing and blends right in. had people think it was part of the clothing. great gift / stocking stuffer i like it, keeps the glasses handy but when you bend over, they can fall out. so good idea, but has its limits. perhaps if it didn't stick out as far, that would hold the glasses tighter. great product! very strong magnet that works in holding and keeping your glasses secure. well worth the price that i paid for it... first showing of this product was on 'shark tank' and it has lived up to expectations!"
22,"Summarize: we've used these filters in our dustbuster for several years. with a little care, such as occasionally blowing it out with air or tapping on sidewalk, they have very long life. seem to catch everything from grit, to dog hair, to fine ashes without letting much blow through exhaust. getting harder to find at local stores, so i bought two. i was disappointed to discover that the filter does not fit the black and decker dustbuster i own. there are nubs around the top that prevent it from working. i have not been able by number or description to locate the proper filter or amazon or anywhere else. this is very disappointing as i purchased the vacuum on amazon. i bought this to replace my tired and dirty filter. after i received it, i realized that there was nothing wrong with the one i already had. (they are washable.) however it helps to have two, so you can change the filter quickly when necessary and not take time to wash the first one. this is the wrong filter if you are buying the <UNK> hand vacuum. amazon pairs it up together and it says it works with all 'cyclonic hand vacs,' but it doesn't. you need the <UNK> for the <UNK>. amazon wrong. product description wrong. me wrong for not reading the reviews first. instead of having to buy an all new dustbuster just because mine is older and the filters aren't in stock anywhere didn't mean i had to <UNK> & pay for a newer one. after having found the filters here, i buy them and they work extremely well. very satisfied. i bought the cordless cyclonic dustbuster <UNK>. the correct filter for the dustbuster <UNK> is replacement filter <UNK>. in the 'frequently bought together' section at amazon, both the <UNK> replacement filter and the <UNK> replacement filter are listed. the <UNK> replacement filter will not fit the <UNK>. this item list listed with the vacuum -- 'frequently bought together' with the black & decker <UNK> 9.6 volt <UNK> cordless dustbuster but this filter does not fit! argh! corrections are needed in the 'frequently bought together' section, and the correct filter needs to be listed. i bought these filters because it said they are often bought with the vaccum i got. recently, i went to put them in the vaccum and discovered they do not fit. to boot, i missed the window to get a refund. rip off!"
23,"Summarize: i really appreciate the method of safety built into this bag. but, it is so large that by the time you put all of your stuff in it, it is hard to carry. certainly could not carry as a cross bag easily. if someone jerked the bag, it is so big and strong, the person might jerk me down to ground! i love this bag although i would have preferred it to be a litle smaller. it is light enough that i can carry my camera, camera accessories, as well as all my normal purse items including my kindle. i love this particular shade of blue. it goes well with most everything i wear. i also appreciate the pockets for separating things. i used this for the first time last week on a trip to maine. we normally drive so i was worried about carrying things on the plane. this handled my camera, binoculars, medicines, treats, glasses and cosmetic case along with two paperback books and three drinking cups. i love it! i checked this on two different monitors before i ordered. both looked more rose color. it's very much a dark purple. which i'll live with since it is for travel, and didn't care about it being subtle it's very large, we'll see how well it hold up this is the purse for all to have when you have children or you need to have it while traveling on trips! seriously, great purse and yes, i paid a little bit more for the mauve as i was tired of black. i just love my purse! took this bag on a recent trip to europe and it was great. no worrying about theft and it is filled with pockets to accomodate all things that you need to take for a day trip. the two outside pockets were great to hold a water bottle or umbrella. it is light weight and has many compartments. i wish it was just a little larger. there is a 400 item which is too <UNK> is a 200 item which is fulls up fast; therefore; i would like to see the company make a 300 series. wish it came in colors but other than its drab appearance it is an amazing bag. i couldn't believe how much stuff i got in there on a recent trip. comfortable to wear with handy pockets and clips in all the right places. love this bag."
24,"Summarize: my son is 3 and this fits him perfectly. he'll probably be able to wear it for the next two years if he'd like. it's cute too. the hat is thin, but completes the outfit. and the candy pocket is huge. perfect! i'm so glad we bought this costume over any other thomas costume. i ordered this for my 3 yr old for halloween. he loved it!! the candy catcher in the front is really neat, but probably need to take a pail or something else along also because it can get to be heavy if they get a lot of candy. i was very pleased with the way it fit and everything. i ordered this costume online and it was perfect for my 20 month old son's second halloween. it was comfortable and he loved the pocket. the size was perfect because it didn't need to be a particular fit. he loved the hat too. every house we went to trick or treat complimented the outfit too. received from <UNK> toys and was very disappointed when i opened the pkg...... very flimsy felt fabric. no 3d sculpted face that i expected. i became creative and added huge googly eyes, pumpkin patch, spiders, bats, and train tracks to the outfit to make it a bit more suitable for my taste. i was pleasantly surprised at how cute this costume is in person. my 3 year old son loved being thomas for halloween, and the candy catcher was a great feature. it also looks like it will grow with him, so we may use it again for halloween next year if he's still <UNK>! this is a cute costume that we got for my lil cousin and the candy pouch is basically the size of the entire costume so that's p cool. i doubt it would fit up to six years old like it's advertised as, but it's the perfect size for him (age 2) my son looked sooooo cute with this costume on. it was well worth the price in my opinion because, his face light up when he seen it in the package. the whole night he kept saying to the doors he got candy from 'me the train, <UNK>!!' my 2 year old loved this costume. he went on the halloween parade at school and everyone said it was very creative that he has his own candy pouch as part of his costume. he also went around the neighborhood and was pretty popular with his thomas the train look."

26,"Summarize: we use it in our office to tell another employee if they have a call on hold, but that is about all it is good for. don't bother trying to have a conversation, clarity is too poor. i didn't realize until after the fact that i should have just bought walkie talkies. at least battery life in these are good. the units work fine and the setup is described in the manual works well. the one thing that my wife and i do not like is the audio. sounds like you are in a box. the calling button is also a bit strange. it first beeps and then you can speak. the distance it covers is very good. don't waste your money on these. although if you try hard enough you can make out what the other person is saying, the audio quality is extremely poor, as is the noise cancellation (if any), and the general sound quality. i wish i had saved the boxes. i'd be sending these back. and the problem is having to wake the kids up in the morning to go to school. they are upstairs and i used to have to trek up and down a couple of times each morning. we put one in each bedroom, 1 in the living room and 1 in the study. problem solved. i searched extensively for an intercom for my large two floor home. i selected this unit (ordering three units) and regret my decision. it was very difficult set up and doesnot work that well. i wish i could get a refund as we never use it. my search continues. took a long time to get and when i finally got them, they didn't seem to work to well joined up (i have 3). also, they should have come with dc chargers, they don't seem to work well with batteries, imho. it is simple to program and operate, which is just what i was looking for. i just wish i didn't have to buy a power cord separately. i am running it on batteries right now, but i am not sure how long they will last. i've spent hours already trying to set up my network and get this system going. the engineering leaves much to be desired. can't get it to work as advertised. the manual is one of the least helpful such documents i've ever seen."
27,"Summarize: i bought two of these hats to keep on our son's boat. they are pretty stylish but most importantly does protect my hair and face from the sun. love the upf protection. the only nominally downside is it is difficult to stay on when the boat is going fast. i think for wear at the beach or just outside it is a great purchase. i needed something for my cruise to hawaii. i ordered this atthe last moment, but amazon came through and i <UNK> the day before i left. i love the look, the feel, the factthat i can fold it and stick it in my suitcase and, best of all, i received compliments on it. i looked at a few sizing charts and they said that 'one size fits all' will fit a head with a circumference of 21 1 / 2 '- 22 1 / 4'. my head is 21 3 / 4 'and this hat sat on the top of my ears! i have returned it. i wear a hat anytime i am outside for any length of time. this hat is cute and provides great sun protection. i have a hat for hiking and a hat for the beach, but this is for more dressy occasions like an outdoor birthday party or a trip to butterfly world with my granddaughter. good quality hat, i love that i can be protected from the sun, and look good too! i'd also like to commend customer service, which was responsive and helpful when i accidentally shipped my order to the wrong address. i have already ordered another hat for my daughter. i spent 2 months at the beach this summer and this hat was great. it kept my head cool even in nearly 100 degree weather and also kept my face protected. i have a fairly large head and had no problem with the one size fits all. loved the stitching design, got a lot of compliements on it. the best part is you can roll it up and pack in your suitcase for travel and it unfolds beautifully. provides the right amount of coverage and stayed on my head in windy conditions. it looks good; it's comfortable; it keeps the sun off my face & neck. i wear it while gardening or for walks. i got it in the moss green and the color is as shown online. i'm glad i bought it."
28,"Summarize: these are tiny, and couldn't hold anything more than keys. they have a diameter of about 3 / 4 of an inch. i wanted to put aprons on them, but they are not big enough, nor strong enough. they have a micro sized magnet on the back that is strong for its tiny appearance. i purchased these hooks specifically for the purpose of hanging potholders on the magnetic fridge. they work but you have to gently hang them to prevent the hooks from sliding down. they may, however, work better on other magnetized surfaces. they are tiny and cute but i would not recommend using them as refrigerator magnets. i purchased the set some years ago and loved how strong the magnets used on the hooks were. i ordered more last week and discovered that the magnets are now 1 / 4 the size on the previous version. the magnets are not at all as strong, and i am very disappointed. these compact magnets sound too good to be true and do actually look nice in-person, but they don't hold the weight. i wanted to hang hot mits on my fridge, but it took some finagling to get it to stay and i could only put one mit per hook. the magnets are very strong in terms of pulling them off the metal <UNK>, they did not work well for my purpose: hanging a picture frame. my frame is an 8x11 <UNK> with a simple frame, but it takes three magnets together to hold it up without sliding downwards. the actual magnets are + / - 1 / 4 'in diameter, not nearly large enough to hang most things. did not work for my 6 keys plus a car <UNK> hooks look good though. that said, i am sending them back. these magnets are definitely not strong enough to be worthwhile, even for light objects. try the ones rated for 25 lbs... even though that's probably overkill for your needs, at least you'll know that they're adequate for any task. for the size of the hanger, it has a very low <UNK>'t hold too much - not even a small kithen towel. might hold a small keychain... had to cannibalize 3 out of the 5 to make 2 hold some weight."

30,"Summarize: i ordered this acupressure mat to see if it would help relieve my back pain and at first it seemed like it wasn't doing much, but once you use it for a second or third time you can feel the pain relief and it also helps you relax. i use it almost everyday now and it really helps. i recommed this product and this seller. i used the mat the first night after it arrived and <UNK> night since. after 2 ten minute sessions, i am sold. i have slept much better at night - i think it puts me in a more relaxed state, making it easier to fall asleep. a rather inexpensive option to relieving tension in my neck, upper back and shoulders. always consult with your doctor before purchasing any circulation product after surgery. i had ankle surgery and this product is useful for blood circulation in the foot. this increase in circulation has assisted with my ability to feel comfortable stepping down on the foot (only after doc said wait bearing was okay). i use it sitting down barefoot. i love these spike mats and have recommended them to everyone that has had any kind of body ache. its great to lay on to relax you after a long day at work. helps with pain in my back and pain in my legs. its not a cure, but it sure helps with the healing process. i run an alternative health center and use acupressure pin mats from different sources to treat my patients, but this product is the patients choice, they are asking allways for this mat against other brands so i changed all of them for britta, moreover the s & h was outstanding and really fast. this is the best thing! you can use socks if your feet are tender to walk on it or bare foot if you can take it. i use it every morning to walk across to jump start my body. when i think about it i will lay on it, it feels wonderful. i wish i hadn't purchased this item. i just can't get use to it, it's not comfortable. i have not seen any benefits from using it but that could be because i don't relax or use it for long enough. i really like the acupressure mat. i usually toss and turn a lot when i sleep, now i use this before i go to bed and it helps relax my body so that i can sleep more sound without all the tossing and turning."
31,"Summarize: i got this because it was a deal. i should've known tomtom has a funny way of making you forced to update maps, and in la a lot of stuff changes so you may as well not even bother with this thing. i use this now as a back-up gps. i just hope this thing does find if and when my phone dies. basic gps unit for those of an older age who do not use smart phones. the screen is small but for the price, a very nice unit. touch screen and color graphics are a nice touch. if you are looking for the no frills, basic navigation system, save $50 + and buy the 'one'. i got this for my granddaughter for christmas and she is thrilled with it. she has her own business and must do a lot of traveling, this has been a great help to her in her travels. she is very pleased with it and i am so glad i got this for her gift. i have purchased this nit back in 2011 and after couple month the battery kept <UNK> researching this problem, it appears there is a known bug that the gps wakes up by itself and drains all <UNK> firmware update ever resolved it.avoid, not recommending, seems like a widely known issue. i got a great deal on this tomtom. not the latest technology (screen size, touch screen / talk options) but had all the features i needed (full street names big visuals). it hasn't dissappointed yet! i would recommended this to anyone. works great. easy to use. sometimes may try to take you on a weird route. still have to have an idea of how you want to get somewhere so that doesnt happen. but, it will always get you to where you want to go. very easy to set up and use! arrived about 2 days sooner than expected. i didn't even have to read the manual to figure out how to use it. i also like the speedometer on it (my car's speedometer isn't working). i'm a novice at electronics, and there are too many processes to go thru to get to what you want (to get to your destination) - once you figure out all of the buttons to push - it's a beautiful thing..."
32,"Summarize: this little guy performs really well and is comfortable to handle for long periods. the blade guard is a little weird in how it pivots, so it's kind of difficult to clean. my guard actually broke off, so i just left it off. the blades on this thing are quite sharp! so be careful if the same happens to you. strong and it works. i made zucchini noodles with this handy little device and now it looks like i'll be making this more <UNK> the noodles and lightly salt them while the noodles are drying, make whatever sauce you are going to pour over them. the heat from the sauce should cook the noodles to a perfect al <UNK>. i am not excited about this peeler and wish i had found an easier tool. i have julienned my fingers using it - very sharp just like their other peelers which i have and love. it is difficult to use on carrots without injuring my fingers, maybe i just can't get the hang of it! this julienne peeler works fantastic! i like the shield, i had to be very careful with my other on in the drawer to not get cut reaching for something. it is so much easier to handle with this grip and the blade stays in place. i would buy this product again. the oxo good grips julienne peeler is a great gadget. i use it to julienne zucchini and eggplant. zucchini julienned and sauteed quickly with evoo, garlic powder, sea salt and fresh ground pepper is a terrific side dish. even people who do not like zucchini will eat this. i bought the kiwi pro slicer, was cheaper and worked 100 times better then the oxo brand. would not buy this brand again. when slicing it leaves all the sliced on the papaya and you can't <UNK> keep slicing because it will fill up with papaya and stop slicing. it's easy to use and clean. it's a good price and does exactly what i wanted. i bought it to make julienne veggies carrots, zucchini noodles. it makes shorter pieces than a big fancy spiralizer, but that's good for me. this is my 3rd purchase of julienne peelers the 1st 2 didn't work\ <UNK> waste of money. this one is the best ever! i have been making zucchini noodles and so many other things! try this recipe i made!

33,"Summarize: i've been using this for about two years and refilled twice. the only thing is i didn't pay attention that this one has a wand which i don't need since i have one and it is still in very good shape. i was looking for just refills. but in any way it's easy to use and works well for us. i love these - most practical bathroom item created - but what is going on??? chlorox customer service advised they have discontinued! what a huge disappointment after throwing away the old brushes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ! who wants to stick their hand in a toilet? not i! i love the wand and the refills are wonderful. no touching required, and they scrub very well! my toilet bowl is gleaming after using these!! i'll never use anything else. i live in a condo and only have 1 toilet that doesn't have to be cleaned every week. so this is perfect. no clutter next to the toilet with unsightly brushes and throwing the tip away after each makes cleaning the bathroom much more palatable. these are great buys. they are smaller than the regular size but well big enough to clean the toilet, much more efficient, i always felt wasting when use the regular ones and now with these, work great and well worth the money. these are great because they are sanitary (unlike the scrubbers that get reused everytime). i use these for one cleaning, then throw away (without having to touch anything!) good scrubbing action, and gets the toilet good and clean. i have been using these for a long time, what i like about them is they are disposable and you do not have to look at a stained toilet bowl brush in the corner. clorox toilet bowl cleaners do a very nice job. i love these cleaners. they are easy to use and do a great job. some people have commented they wish they had more cleaning agent, but i think they have more than enough and often use one to clean two toilets."
34,"Summarize: this case fits perfectly on my 14inch hp. i disagree with the comments that talk about the smell being terrible. the smell really wasn't that strong and went away after a couple of weeks. i love the design and it was a fair price. shipping was a little expensive though. it arrived quickly and i would buy from this seller again. this was bought for our teen daughter for christmas, the only negative things about it are <UNK> strap <UNK> pockets, other than that it is great, but in all fairness i knew both things about it when ordered, it came in very fast, was just as described, great item for the price. i have a dell inspiron 14, and the cover is a little snug. it's working well though and now i can carry my laptop in my school backpack rather than carry a separate laptop bag. i'd recommend this product, just do a bunch of research to make sure it will fit. i bought it for my acer 14 ', it is a little bit tight, but the worst was it has heavy rubber smell, when i leave the case in my room, the rubber smell was filled with the air everywhere of my room, made me sick. don't buy it. i like this case very much! it fits my acer aspire 14 'as a glove!!! yes, it smells a little bit but i wouldn't say that it's so bad as mentioned in some reviews. and it's very cute too. i recommend this product to anyone. love the design of this sleeve. when i don't have a table i use the sleeve as a mat to protect my thighs from the heat of my laptop. wish it had a bit more padding and cushion but other than that it's a pretty carrying sleeve. i really love it! it doesn't smell a lot as some reviews say and the draw is well <UNK> bought this size for a 13.3 'because my laptop will have a cover on it so i don't know how it fits for a traditional 14 inch, i really enjoy the design of this case but i thought it would be lighter. when it came, it was a very dark grey which was a bummer. but the quality is good and it has a nice thick padding to protect my laptop."
35,"Summarize: i usually wear size 37, but found a 38 feels better in this sandal. i absolutely love this sandal. so supportive and comfortable, although at first i did get a blister on my big toe. do not let this be the deciding factor. it stretched out and is now fabulous. i love it so much that i bought it in three colors. my wife is a nurse and wears dansko shoes. we were excited to try the new crimson sandal and normally order 39 sandal and 40 closed toe. some other reviews were right about a narrow width and tight toe box. we gave them a try and passed a great pair of shoes to our daughter with her long narrow feet, and she loves them... finally, a dansko sandal that's fashion forward! it was love at first sight! this is my 4th dansko purchase. their sizing, quality and comfort is very consistent. i love the <UNK> of this sandal and i'm pleased they are offering bolder colors. another feature i love is the <UNK> <UNK> - it's soft and keeps feet dry. i have several pairs of dansko clogs that are all size 39 and fit perfectly. so i felt confident when i ordered the <UNK> sandal in size 39. i don't know if a 40 would be too large but the 39 seems a little small. otherwise, i love them. they are very cushiony and comfortable! i own many dansko shoes and these are among my favorites. they have all the support that dansko offers in its shoes plus they are very attractive. i love the the heel height and instant comfort. they look great with slacks and dresses, dressed up or not... i love these sandals. the fit is perfect for my foot, with perfect arch support. i don't think the leather is cheap, and the sandals are very comfortable to walk in. they are very pretty, and pair very well with pants and dresses. this is a really cute shoe that feels very comfortable on my high arches. the strap on the instep fits my feet very well, but i have very slim feet. i can see how it would be uncomfortably tight on anyone with more padding on their feet. i really love these sandals. my only issue is after wearing them for a while my feet started to swell as i have a high instep and they were a little tight across the top. i'm sure they will stretch a bit after a few wears"
