0,"Summarize: the box looked like it had been opened, and then re-taped for resell. one of the chairs was broken, and the broken piece was nowhere close to the originating piece. possibly other pieces damaged too, though didn't bother looking, instead just re-taped it back up to be sent back. i hope they don't just resell it to someone else. i love my new dining room set. the set is very sturdy, the walnut finish is a nice color.this set is great for a small area, kitchen <UNK> not recommend for a large eating <UNK> is small and so are the <UNK> strong enough to hold big boys and girls, thumps up, great price, packed well, arrived in a timely matter. the table and chairs are very nice but not quite the color i expected (but i am getting used to it). table and chairs delivered by the carrier right on time and with no damage. very easy to assemble, but very difficult to get out of the box it was so well protected. it fits perfectly in the kitchen at the office. my staff assembled it without any delay. everyone loves the dining set and they can't believe i ordered it on-line. i made the measurements and made sure of the dimensions of the room and the dining set and it's a perfect fit. it was easy to put together and looks great. however, when the item was shipped to me, one of the backs of the chairs was broken. i just fixed it myself with wood glue. its not even visible now. the rest of it was in perfect condition. moved to smaller living quarters and this just fits the bill. color is perfect and it was easy to assemble. one fault to find is that the top scratches easily. it even came with a scratch. other than that it is fine. i received this table and chairs completely damaged. the customer service experience with this company was terrible. in my opinion, this set is cheap and overpriced. it's not durable and not worth the money. don't waste your time. this table was super easy to put together. the table and chairs are solid and sturdy! the seats are very comfortable. the table is the perfect size for our not so big kitchen. we are very pleased with this purchase."
1,"Summarize: don't get me wrong, they're really good boots, but they used to make them better. my last pair from a few years ago were much higher quality. thicker sole, better full grain leather, now they only make the black in 'grease', which stains all my socks black. keeping them, but still disappointed in frye. every woman needs a pair of these frye boots! fit is true to normal size. i wear a standard 9. these fit in the shaft for any ladies who have bigger calves as i do. you have to fight to get them on first few times and they wear stiff until fully broken in. worth the money and break in time. boots excellent quality, beautiful skin, a modern model. but! they are very narrow! this is the second pair of shoes is a brand and my 8.5 size fits me perfectly, even he little more than usual. but these are very narrow! go to a cobbler, let him try to stretch. be careful! they were comfortable the moment i put them on. the sizes are exact. the color the way they are made are what i expect from frye which i've been wearing since the 70's. with a <UNK> break from not wearing frye it was a pleasant surprise the quality has stood the test of time. what great boots! they do take some breaking in - like all real leather does. run maybe a tad small in the general spectrum, but hey, remember the break in period. look fabulous, will last me for the next twenty years.... they bridge the fashion vs. function <UNK> beautifully. i really like these boots. they can be a beast to get on, like any boot fit to last; once on, they are incredibly comfortable. i have had them for 4 years and they still look great - worn in but not worn out... i bought it just for the heavy snow cuz my ugg got wet <UNK> though it is a little expensive, but the boots are nice and it was shipped to me for only two days.!!!!!! i love it bought these for the wife to have something to kick around in and keep up with the kids, but she doesn't like them. her heel lifts with every step, and they're stiff and heavy. not an everyday casual shoe."
2,"Summarize: i bought this to test it out for charging my phone on at section hikes. for the added weight, it was a <UNK> item. i probably wouldn't have it on a <UNK>, but it worked well and if you aren't going to have access to a power source for recharging your phone while you're out, it does the job pretty well. i left it out for 24 hours in direct sun, the lights on the side showing the progress of charging blindly blinked, but the charge gave my ipod only 1 / 10 of full battery. i tried again and placed it in the sun for 2 sunny days straight, again, after multiple annoying blinking signals, it did not charge anything. returned. the product is great .the issue is that it came broken and i only found out after i had it for a month. there is no was to call there support. very very bad idea. will do more research next time .i don't think i would buy it again!!! ! this is my first solar charger, so i can't compare it to any others. i will say that the flashlight is extremely bright as noted by others. it seems to do a nice job charging my droid bionic but it didn't seem to work on the kindle fire. this product recharges my wife's iphone 4 with no problem. one downside - it does not have enough juice to charge an ipad. it would benefit from some indication of the percentage charge of the battery. also, the led light is very bright. charges up, charges your devices. the flashlight is really bright. i had to take a star off because the charge battery doesn't hold a charge over a period of time. however don't go cheap, this product is worth the money. this solar charger works perfectly. it can be charged with electricity or solar power making it a great backup for charging devices. for its size i would recommend getting one and putting it in your but out bag for use with <UNK>. i ordered this charger to take on safari to south africa. it is suppose to charge an iphone and kindles. it doesn't work with either of mine. it was a waste of money for me. i'm very disappointed."
3,"Summarize: our photocopy machine jams often - the high humidity is a factor for that. we have placed the <UNK> <UNK> gel can on the photocopy tray that feeds the paper to the machine. the slender dimension allowed us to do that. so far, we've had fewer jams. i've also used a larger <UNK> desiccant in the cabinet where we store the paper. this dry pack as it's so called wouldn't even keep the humidity level in my small handgun safe down at an acceptable level, i even tried recharging it and it still did not work properly. i keep a electronic humidity monitor in my safe, and this dry pack would drop the humidity 1 or 2 percent from what it was without the pack. even though the humidity in the areas i used them ranges from 40% to 57%, the dry packs turned green much too quickly to be worth ordering more. i bought ten, and with a week or so, already some require 2 hours in the oven to dry out. way too much energy. i'll probably need a stationary <UNK>. my husband is a <UNK> and has a horse hoof that he uses in educating his clients. he has been using silica gel that he has pulled out of other packaging and so has not had a chance to evaluate this item. he likes the small size and the fact that it has an indicator on it. love this little unit. small enough to place in any container i chose and also 'rechargeable' by drying it out in an oven. color indicator is very helpful to determine if moisture contamination has occured. recommend for tropical zones and protecting valuable <UNK> or jewelry. nice quality for the case. little window is convenient for seeing color crystals. convenient shape for my purposes. works as well as any other brands i've had. case looks durable.i use these for protecting very expensive microphones i keep in sealed tupperware style cases. i put this in my safe because some things in it seemed to be 'soggy. i had to recharge it by baking it. the only this i would change was to buy a couple or get a bigger one to extract more water. i'm really not sure how good this is going to work. according to the instructions when the indicator turns green you are suppose to put it in the oven and dry it out. when i got mine the indicator was already mostly green."

5,"Summarize: i noticed that several reviews indicated that users were using this machine to both press and cook their tortillas. this machine works in the same way as the 3000 dollar tortilla press except no automatic operation, that said a tortilla press needs to be hot to keep the tortilla from shrinking, however the tortilla needs to be finished cooking on a griddle for best results. great machine!!! i use it 3-4 times a week and perfect tortillas every time. i also make pizza crusts, pancakes and crepes. you have to get the recipe and technique right for tortillas but once you do it is easy. love having a freezer full of bean burritos for a quick lunch. for this price, plus the pennys you'll spend on a 3-4 ingredient mix, this appliance pays for itself in about 2 months at our house. tortillas taste so fresh, no yucky preservatives, and you'll save tons not buying anymore bleached white over-priced tortillas at the grocery store. the machine is very tricky. it requires some trial and errors to make it work right. i do not like to put oil in the dough; however, it appears to me that without oil it is impossible to make tortilla or <UNK>. it is useless for me. it worked great for 6 months and suddenly stopped working. cucinapro customer care was pretty useful in replacing the defective one with brand new one within a week. thanks for a great customer service!!! hopefully, this one won't go bad in next 6 months. fun and easy to use! took me one batch to get my technique worked out, but it was very simple, easy to follow directions. easy clean up too! i would recommend this to anyone looking for an electric tortilla maker! i love this tortilla maker. i hate to buy them from the store and they sit in my fridge. this way i make them on the night we eat them. yes you should grill them after to get the toasted look. i bought this for my boyfriend for making roti but it flattens too much and so you don't get the air pockets and flakiness that you want in roti. probably great and easy for tortillas but we just don't eat them."
6,"Summarize: of the fact that an sd card is not included with this camera. it is essential (you can only take 2 pix with the camera's internal memory) and it is standard practice to include one with a camera. so add c. $25 to any advertised price that you see here. camera itself is fine. sharp pictures. impressed with the low light capability. almost as close as my dslr. ample shot configuration via auto presets as well as some options. would have loved to have a bigger display screen, or one with swiveling capability. adequate flash for indoor and night shot settings. sturdy and slips easily into pocket. after looking in the consumer reports for a new camera i came along this one. it was number one on the <UNK> was a good price so i bought it. it takes a little time to learn about the choices and setting up but then it's easy to use. i love my camera. the battery is constantly malfunctioning making the camera unusable. i was on a <UNK> trip in malaysia in august and this happened constantly. the on / off button is also <UNK>, besides that is very poorly designed. what good are all kinds of features when their usability is way below par! ? have only used the camera a short time but am really impressed with all the features and marvel at the detail of almost any type photo situation. the low light feature is outstanding and will be very helpful in museums and other venues where flash is not allowed. overall i love this camera. i bought this camera based on consumer reports review. it has met most of the <UNK>. its picture quality is better than the cannon 110 hs that it is replacing. i had to glue a riser on the on / off button since it was too small for my thumb love this camera for quality picture taking and size. very easy to use and takes professional photos. i like to take my camera everywhere and this is the perfect size. it's a great first camera to explore with before investing in a dslr. i have <UNK>, mirrorless camera which is over <UNK>, but this camera, nikon one is almost as good as my fancy mirrorless camera.. i just love it! light, easy to carry around and pictures are just great. satisfied."
7,"Summarize: she loves the shoes! my girlfriend is picky about shoes and avoids online purchases. i asked her to find a pair of athletic shoes that look attractive. she gave me her size and i purchased them. they are lightweight and she says they cushion her feet well. she has been wearing them for long walks and tandem bike rides since she received them! i usually wear a size women's 10. nike shoes run small, so i usually waer an 11 in nike. these reeboks fit more true to size, but i still ordered a 10.5 and the fit is great! the shoe seems durable and well-made. it forms to my foot and supports my arch very well. these shoes are awsome. i have a really hard time finding running shoes due to a high arch and the need for a shoe between a neutral shoe and a stability shoe these shoes felt great right out of the box. they run true to size and the colors are great. great shoe for a great price. got a blister the first time wearing them. they did nothing for the foot pain experienced from wearing cheaper shoes. guess i was expecting too much, but i refuse to pay the ridiculously high prices charged nowadays. i'm sure they are just as good as those costing $100 more. nice colors! these are a must have item...!! they are totally awesome on my feet and feel like a dream. i do a lot of <UNK> and these little cuties are rad..!! totally light weight but real cushie..... love em 'and would definitely buy from this seller again..! ! the shoes are the perfect fit for me. they supply the support that i need yet are flexible and comfortable. i wear these all day in my 2nd grade classroom and my feet are not tired at the end of the day. i will be buying another pair in a different color. it is very comfortable and the bottom is really soft on my feet. i usually wear 8 but i had to get a 7 in this. so it ran large for me. i have wide feet though too. very stylish. i enjoy wearing them running and casually as well. i overpronate and should have known better than to buy these shoes. they are really sharp looking and probably would work for someone with a regular feet. i wish i could have kept them as i did get lots of compliments at the gym when wearing them;)"
8,"Summarize: as other people mentioned the liner in these are super small. i took them on vacation to hawaii and on the second day i cut out the bottom of the liner. the waist fits fine but the liner inside is not sized accordingly. i just cut the liner at the bottom so i could be comfortable and all was well after that. my wife said i had to buy a proper pair of swim trunks for an upcoming cruise. seems my use of cut off jeans would embarrass her on the cruise we took. the pockets are deep enough to keep things in and the cargo pockets are good for keeping various items like sunglasses.i guess i will have to retire the <UNK>. shorts have a good look and feel. fit about as expected but the mesh is a little tighter than i'd like.

10,"Summarize: the prettiest sterling silver piece i own now. i get so many compliments on this necklace. i bought it for myself from my hubby for valentine's day. why not? when people ask where i got it, i simply say from my loving hubby. and he is off the hook as to what to get me. win + win. this pendant is so unique!! the design is beautiful and the bail is a ring instead of the typical bail which gives it a nice touch!! all the corners are smooth and my daughter loves it - looks great on her.i cannot say anything about the chain because used our own chain. :) satisfied. item is nice. not a great quality item, but right for the price. charm was larger than i expected (i expected small and elegant, but it was large and almost costume jewelry like). i think it is a good necklace, just not what i expected. over all service has been great the only problem, i ordered a purple mickey mouse case for iphone 4s they sent a black, n i felt it was to much trouble n such a small item to send back so needless to say its put back in a drawer somewhere when i received the package, i was surprised and amazed because the necklace is so elegant, beautiful and the same as the picture shown here. i really love this necklace. it has a unique pendant designed. i will recommend it to someone to order it now... i got this as a present for my gf on valintines day. she loves it and wears it every day! its not cheap looking and it hasn't broken yet. the chain hasn't broken either even though it is very thin. strongly recomend it! i love hearts and i love 'love':) i do not have any negative feedback, the necklace is perfect and the charm is perfect. i just thought it would have been slightly bigger. overall, i love my new heart necklace. it look perfect in a womens neck!! great gift, i thought for the price it was going to look cheap, but i was far wrong. it look <UNK> great reward from your woman when you give this to her; d"
11,"Summarize: this little guy performs really well and is comfortable to handle for long periods. the blade guard is a little weird in how it pivots, so it's kind of difficult to clean. my guard actually broke off, so i just left it off. the blades on this thing are quite sharp! so be careful if the same happens to you. strong and it works. i made zucchini noodles with this handy little device and now it looks like i'll be making this more <UNK> the noodles and lightly salt them while the noodles are drying, make whatever sauce you are going to pour over them. the heat from the sauce should cook the noodles to a perfect al <UNK>. i am not excited about this peeler and wish i had found an easier tool. i have julienned my fingers using it - very sharp just like their other peelers which i have and love. it is difficult to use on carrots without injuring my fingers, maybe i just can't get the hang of it! this julienne peeler works fantastic! i like the shield, i had to be very careful with my other on in the drawer to not get cut reaching for something. it is so much easier to handle with this grip and the blade stays in place. i would buy this product again. the oxo good grips julienne peeler is a great gadget. i use it to julienne zucchini and eggplant. zucchini julienned and sauteed quickly with evoo, garlic powder, sea salt and fresh ground pepper is a terrific side dish. even people who do not like zucchini will eat this. i bought the kiwi pro slicer, was cheaper and worked 100 times better then the oxo brand. would not buy this brand again. when slicing it leaves all the sliced on the papaya and you can't <UNK> keep slicing because it will fill up with papaya and stop slicing. it's easy to use and clean. it's a good price and does exactly what i wanted. i bought it to make julienne veggies carrots, zucchini noodles. it makes shorter pieces than a big fancy spiralizer, but that's good for me. this is my 3rd purchase of julienne peelers the 1st 2 didn't work\ <UNK> waste of money. this one is the best ever! i have been making zucchini noodles and so many other things! try this recipe i made!

12,"Summarize: i love these protein bars in the vanilla flavor. they taste like rice krispies treats with vanilla frosting. i can't believe they are actually 'good' for you. i usually try to stay away from processed foods, but these are my guilty pleasure -- i eat them for dessert all the time. i like them much better than the chocolate nugo bars. i find these a little chewy (my jaw gets tired towards the very end), but that could just be me. i love these. i think the flavor is good. they keep me feeling fuller longer than other brands that i've had. my work has them and i loved them so much i ended up coming here to get a whole box. i love this flavor of nugo bars. not many grocery stores carry it, so when they do i buy all they have on the shelves. when i am out of them i have to order them online. i always keep one or two in my purse for when i am out and hungry and don't care to buy junk food. i tried these for the first time at work, and loved them. but they sell them for $<UNK> a bar! and even though they are totally worth it, i wanted to purchase my own box. my kids even got to try them and they really like them too! i will be ordering two boxes next time around! nugo bars are great for breakfast, lunch or a snack. i keep them in my desk at work and my husband keeps them in his car. eat them with a tall glass of water and they will keep you satisfied for hours. they are <UNK> and taste great. i'm so glad i can order these from amazon! love the bar, love the taste, love the 170 calories... love it, my husband and son love it <UNK> eat way too many of them but i dont feel guilty as it is a great and healthy snack on the go!! this one is my favorite of all! very good! we all eat these and other bars in our house for meal replacements. these are one of their favorites but they are very sweet! in comparison, there are bars that have better ingredients but this one is good! they remind me of rice krispy treats! apart from the obvious nutritional value, the taste was surprisingly better than i anticipated. normally, if i find <UNK> nutritional bars tend to have a chalky or <UNK> texture and taste. i dare say, the texture reminds me of a <UNK> 'rice krispy treat'."
13,"Summarize: boiling broccoli always adds a ton of water and makes it super soggy, but this is the best way to cook broccoli (and other things of course...) i would definately recommend this product. the only downfall is that it's pretty big and we have no <UNK> space, so it makes it difficult to store it and make room for it. sometimes i use the steamer for just one vegetable, or for rice, but it's really nice to have the separate basket when i want to steam two separate vegetables at the same time. i've been very pleased with the steamer and have used it several times already. the instruction book in helpful too. thank you. i love this steamer. everyone in my family now has one because they are so great. it is easy to use and easy to clean. i love using it to make rice - no more cleaning up <UNK> rice from the stove! it also makes corn on the cob and boiled eggs hassle free. this is our second b / d steamer. the first served us well for years before the plexiglass bowl cracked and finally broke. it was impossible to find a replacement in any major chain stores. lots of rice steamers but no small in size vegetable steamers. amazon came through again. thanks jeff! this is my second one of these steamers. i used the first one almost daily for over 5 years. i love the versitility of this item. makes excellent steamed shrimp, the rice is perfect every time, vegetables taste great. just a useful item to have in the kitchen. i bought this one as a replacement for an old one i had. we cook with it every day and love it! it is the perfect size for our family. although the picture shows it with a clear lid, the one i received in the mail had a white lid. i had an almost identical steamer from black & decker purchased around 1985. the lid on that one finally broke and i've been looking for one like it for 2 years. nice to see a good design hasn't been changed. love the steamer! i love this steamer. i use it to steam all kinds of vegetables and new potatoes. i really like the larger basket and the screen where you can put herbs or spices to flavor what you are cooking. i highly recommend it."
14,"Summarize: i bought this purse and was worried it wouldnt come as it said in the ad. when it arrived at my home i was more than extatic when i saw how nice it was. i am actually very impressed by this purse, and reccomend it to any one looking to spice up there out fit. looks great with boots and leggings! i chose it because it's a beautiful purse, but too many straps (4) they come off, but then the connecter is still visible. i had to return it, i couldn't even see a way to have my leather person doctor it up without ruining the beauty of it. i was all about this bag and then when ups brought it i was not to happy, the bag is way to small the straps are to short and one of the straps was <UNK> i will b e returning or give it to my daughter to play with. love this! pretty size: not to big? not to small, color and shape! and very flashy. everyone loves it! all the stones were on it when it arrived at my house and only one fell off as i was trying it out! i like the purse, but you definitely can't carry it often because the stones fall off a lot. its a decent size snd the material is a decent quality. i would love the purse if the stones didn't fall off. i have had this purse less than a month and now all 3 straps broke!!!! worst quality ever!!!!! had to throw it away!! 40 $(after shipping) down the toilet! ! the bag is a lot smaller than it appears, i though i could fit my school books in it but i definitely cannot. however it's a really cute bag and i will still get a lot of use out of it. i hate this bag! it's horrible, it's the worst bag i've ever got! it broke the first day i got it and didn't even carry it! it's definitely not the size i thought it was!"
15,"Summarize: i have had a ton a problems with these discs. after about 30 minutes of a dvd, it begins to get choppy and become unviewable. looking at the burn side of the disc, there is a area where you can see the burning stopped and i guess picked again. do not recommend. the box was too big and allow the spindle to bounce around in box and plastic covering spindle which keeps the blank dvd in place was broken and dvd were off the spindle. if that is the only size boxes have should put more packing so it will not allow spindle to move at all. yes, hp dvd's are dvd's for the better. better price. better quality. i have used these over the years for many different projects and the quality is there and so is the price. i have had trouble with some other brand named dvd's, but not with hp. vendor describes the product as being gold in color. it is not it is silver. i know that hp no longer manufactures the gold <UNK> was hoping this vendor had some gold version of dvd + r in it inventory. they need change the picture and description to silver instead of gold. been purchasing only hp dvd + r media for 8 years or more. always got the hp branded gold coated. made by cmc, with id of <UNK>. this batch is not gold as portrayed in the photo, it's silver coated, but still the same id. produces about 25% coasters, and another 10-15% that won't play on dvd players. the first half was about what i expected, a few coasters, a couple minor errors. the second half i was lucky to get maybe 5 that worked flawlessly. no good! ive always bought the hp dvd + r 100 pk and find that they go a long way, seldom do i find a coaster in the pack... <UNK> his was my first time purchasing the 100 pk from amazon, but so far so good. after receiving this dvd + r, i think i should order the 50 piece spindle. i did not burn too often. i believe it is enough for 2 years. i tried a couple of discs, anyway, like it."
16,"Summarize: i love this steamer and am purchasing a second one! it's a great size for a single person to steam veggies or even microwave fish, and the silicone makes it so easy to clean and store. the apple green color is cheerful and i love i can eat from the container (i hate doing dishes lol). i have used this steamer every day since i have gotten it. it steams zucchini perfect in as little as 2 minutes. it makes perfect steamed cauliflower in 3 minutes. i will never tire of how fast it makes my vegetables and the ease of clean up time! ! the item cooks a small serving of vegetables okay but its so floppy to hold onto that i won't buy anymore silicone cookwear / <UNK>. my microwave is up over the stove and its too hard to hold onto a floppy item when taking it out and its hot. as previously reviewed, this steamer is not overly sized. perfect for single servings / possibly two. easy to clean. i have a steam setting on my microwave that protests that the lid doesn't fit snuggly enough. again, you get what you pay for. not sure i really like this. because it's made of silicone, it's very flexible. that means it spills easily. it's also quite small, as other reviewers have pointed out. it's good for making small portions for one or two people. i use it all the time for my veggies. it steams my broccoli or green beans in 2.5-3 mins and they are perfect. the container is flimsy and can be hot out of microwave, but rinses off easily and is rest to go again. i liked this steamer when i got it, but it has gotten to be a very unstable item to try and use. i hate taking it out of microwave when hot because i am afraid of it dumping hot food all over me. i'm glad i tried this steamer. it is so easy to use and the veggie and fish tasted so much better! i think this will help me to stick to my weight loss goal by keeping me full eating more veggies."

18,"Summarize: i bought two of these hats to keep on our son's boat. they are pretty stylish but most importantly does protect my hair and face from the sun. love the upf protection. the only nominally downside is it is difficult to stay on when the boat is going fast. i think for wear at the beach or just outside it is a great purchase. i needed something for my cruise to hawaii. i ordered this atthe last moment, but amazon came through and i <UNK> the day before i left. i love the look, the feel, the factthat i can fold it and stick it in my suitcase and, best of all, i received compliments on it. i looked at a few sizing charts and they said that 'one size fits all' will fit a head with a circumference of 21 1 / 2 '- 22 1 / 4'. my head is 21 3 / 4 'and this hat sat on the top of my ears! i have returned it. i wear a hat anytime i am outside for any length of time. this hat is cute and provides great sun protection. i have a hat for hiking and a hat for the beach, but this is for more dressy occasions like an outdoor birthday party or a trip to butterfly world with my granddaughter. good quality hat, i love that i can be protected from the sun, and look good too! i'd also like to commend customer service, which was responsive and helpful when i accidentally shipped my order to the wrong address. i have already ordered another hat for my daughter. i spent 2 months at the beach this summer and this hat was great. it kept my head cool even in nearly 100 degree weather and also kept my face protected. i have a fairly large head and had no problem with the one size fits all. loved the stitching design, got a lot of compliements on it. the best part is you can roll it up and pack in your suitcase for travel and it unfolds beautifully. provides the right amount of coverage and stayed on my head in windy conditions. it looks good; it's comfortable; it keeps the sun off my face & neck. i wear it while gardening or for walks. i got it in the moss green and the color is as shown online. i'm glad i bought it."

20,"Summarize: this utensil crock met all my expectations! i love the color and it holds quite a few kitchen tools! i'm glad i didn 't go with the <UNK> size! great size, fits easily in a corner on my countertop! if you need a handy storage containter and want it to look great on your counter top this is what you want! tired of fighting to get my cooking utensils out of another type of vessel le creuset proves once again to be my top choice in the kitchen. this crock gives plenty of space for over a dozen everyday utensils, looks perfect on the counter and is not too large getting in the way of work space. the white color is classic for any decor. i love this utensil crock! le creuset has never let me down and the color is just fabulous. by being larger than expected, i was delighted to find that all my cooking tools fit, with room to spare. its a perfect addition to my kitchen, and its a magnificent color. this crock is very large and gives you plenty of room for utensils (especially now that many utensils have the thick rubber handles). i was able to condense from 2 drawers to 1 now that i have this crock on the counter. seems very high quality and looks beautiful. i just redid my kitchen all in purple. this is a great color and it is really big. i bought two of them and i am so happy, it holds a lot of utensils. and very pretty too. it is sturdy, not cheap junk. i was having such a hard time finding a large enough utensil crock, that of course also matched my d\ <UNK>. i have the chunky orange utensil set from rachael ray & definitely needed something this size. it's perfect & beautiful. love it! for some reason the crock shows to be taller and slimmer in this color, but it's not. it's the wider and slightly shorter one i wanted. it's very pretty. plenty room for everything, including the utinsils with the larger rubber handles. i love the color and it fits in with other pieces that i have. it is a good size for holding items. it is a slightly different shape than the one i already had so it makes a nice contrast sitting on the counter top."
21,"Summarize: if you're looking for just a heart rate monitor (it is waterproof and good for swimming) then this is for you. there aren't any bells and whistles at all. straight forward, heart rate, time of exercise and that's it. the log only stores your last workouts data, you need to record it before you start another session. this is a good monitor if you have no need for the fancy training models. beginner or <UNK> runners should stick to basic types like this. the polar monitors i have had like this are well-made and easy to use and this is no exception. i am coming off a long <UNK> and plan to use this to work back into shape without risking <UNK>. i ordered and polar <UNK> and it was confirmed after the order was processed. when i got the email for confirmation, it said <UNK>. they did the old bait and switch on me! i immediately returned it and very upset with the order after going through a long process of doing research for a hrm. very dissatisfied! i was disapointed to find the booklet with it didn't help with any instructions on use. but after checking the manual on the internet i was able to set it up and use it. it is much easier than others i have purchased. this is what i was looking for. ease of use. i bought this monitor as a newcomer to heart rate monitors. it is easy to use right out of the box and makes working out more enjoyable - you can make sure that you are working hard enough to improve, but not too hard. very good value. extremely easy to use, only one button. seems to be fairly accurate. has a backlight and can beep to warn you if you fall out of a target heart range that is completely programmable. however, the battery is not replaceable and the screen scratches easily. it's my first heart rate monitor. very useful. i always run with it to control my pace. the problem is when i run more then 1 hour because i don't see the seconds as it has only 4 digits on the display. this was very well-rated on consumer reports. i really like that you can plug in your target heart rate, and it has an audible alert to let you know when you're there. the display is easy to read and it's light-weight."
22,"Summarize: of the fact that an sd card is not included with this camera. it is essential (you can only take 2 pix with the camera's internal memory) and it is standard practice to include one with a camera. so add c. $25 to any advertised price that you see here. camera itself is fine. sharp pictures. impressed with the low light capability. almost as close as my dslr. ample shot configuration via auto presets as well as some options. would have loved to have a bigger display screen, or one with swiveling capability. adequate flash for indoor and night shot settings. sturdy and slips easily into pocket. after looking in the consumer reports for a new camera i came along this one. it was number one on the <UNK> was a good price so i bought it. it takes a little time to learn about the choices and setting up but then it's easy to use. i love my camera. the battery is constantly malfunctioning making the camera unusable. i was on a <UNK> trip in malaysia in august and this happened constantly. the on / off button is also <UNK>, besides that is very poorly designed. what good are all kinds of features when their usability is way below par! ? have only used the camera a short time but am really impressed with all the features and marvel at the detail of almost any type photo situation. the low light feature is outstanding and will be very helpful in museums and other venues where flash is not allowed. overall i love this camera. i bought this camera based on consumer reports review. it has met most of the <UNK>. its picture quality is better than the cannon 110 hs that it is replacing. i had to glue a riser on the on / off button since it was too small for my thumb love this camera for quality picture taking and size. very easy to use and takes professional photos. i like to take my camera everywhere and this is the perfect size. it's a great first camera to explore with before investing in a dslr. i have <UNK>, mirrorless camera which is over <UNK>, but this camera, nikon one is almost as good as my fancy mirrorless camera.. i just love it! light, easy to carry around and pictures are just great. satisfied."
23,"Summarize: i don't believe these shoes will fit anyone who wears a narrow. if i order my true size, they're too short and my toes hit the front of the shoe yet if i order the next size up they're too wide yet my toes still hit in the same place. both pairs went back -- bummer! the shoe is so comfortable and i bought another 'walking' shoe by ahnu which is perfect <UNK> a cute and comfy shoe to do lots of walking in europe this spring. these will fit the bill.i found this style was a little big so i had to get a half size smaller and it is <UNK> reviews said to buy a size smaller. i wear a 7 so ordered the 6.5. it was still too big, and i'm guessing a 6 would fit. i bought the ahnu sandal at 6.5 and it fit perfectly. i plan to reorder the shoe but in a size 6. i would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a very comfortable walking shoe with some style. i can wear these instead of sneakers for less casual events. the shoes run big. i normally wear a 7 1 / 2, but ended up with the 7 which fit just right. i always take a 7 or 7.5, in fact own a pair of flipflops from this brand in a 7, decided to order 7.5 and it fits more like a 8.5 or even a 9. way too large. am returning & hope to replace with a smaller size. i ordered these shoes in a half size smaller than my regular size due to reviews that i read, but they were still too small. they were pretty shoes, so was very disappointed. the company was very good about refunding my money very quickly. fit as expected. have trouble with my feet: neuromas, plantar fasciitis, and bunion. looking for comfortable cushioned for quick trips to run errands without putting on sneakers and sneakers. these work great for me but not for all day use. i am in and out of areas where the footing can be slippery. i wanted a cute but totally functional shoe and this is it. incredibly lightweight! i bet i could run in these. great all around casual working shoe."
24,"Summarize: we've had this for about two months and use it in our baby's nursery. i like it so far. the sound fills the room well. there aren't a bunch of options in sound, but that doesn't matter at all to me. the unit is small and does the job well. i'd recommend it. this machine is small enough to travel well. it only makes one type of sound (kind of like rain) so all you can adjust is the intensity and volume. it shorted out and would stop and start which wakes you up defeating the purpose. it is too expensive for having no sound selections and being cheaply made. we have a full-size analog model of the marpac sleep mate sound conditioner, and have used it for years at home, but it's too bulky to pack. this model is compact, and sounds pretty much like the original. there is no repeating 'loop' of sound to drive you crazy. we've used marpac machines before and they were excellent; but this travel machine didn't make the grade. sound not loud enough for us and the construction didn't seem any better than the $20 ones we've used. this was $50 +. we returned it to amazon. don't let the 1980's packaging fool you, this is an amazing little machine. the sound is robust, and the ability to dial in the mixture of rain and water effects is <UNK>... when will they release an app so i can use it on my phone at the office... my husband and i use a white noise machine in our condo, and love it. when we traveled, we never felt we slept as well without that background noise. we have tried the free apps on our phones, but they are not as good as this. i'd like to give it a review but no power adapter with cord and so on was included. i got a plug adapter for international use, but nothing to power the unit. i have no idea how good it is and am returning it. this product does not drown out sound but is a sleep conditioner. it was purchased for my grandaughter who is going on a mission trip to africa (it takes batteries) and to college in nc. it is a perfect traveling size."
25,"Summarize: i really appreciate the method of safety built into this bag. but, it is so large that by the time you put all of your stuff in it, it is hard to carry. certainly could not carry as a cross bag easily. if someone jerked the bag, it is so big and strong, the person might jerk me down to ground! i love this bag although i would have preferred it to be a litle smaller. it is light enough that i can carry my camera, camera accessories, as well as all my normal purse items including my kindle. i love this particular shade of blue. it goes well with most everything i wear. i also appreciate the pockets for separating things. i used this for the first time last week on a trip to maine. we normally drive so i was worried about carrying things on the plane. this handled my camera, binoculars, medicines, treats, glasses and cosmetic case along with two paperback books and three drinking cups. i love it! i checked this on two different monitors before i ordered. both looked more rose color. it's very much a dark purple. which i'll live with since it is for travel, and didn't care about it being subtle it's very large, we'll see how well it hold up this is the purse for all to have when you have children or you need to have it while traveling on trips! seriously, great purse and yes, i paid a little bit more for the mauve as i was tired of black. i just love my purse! took this bag on a recent trip to europe and it was great. no worrying about theft and it is filled with pockets to accomodate all things that you need to take for a day trip. the two outside pockets were great to hold a water bottle or umbrella. it is light weight and has many compartments. i wish it was just a little larger. there is a 400 item which is too <UNK> is a 200 item which is fulls up fast; therefore; i would like to see the company make a 300 series. wish it came in colors but other than its drab appearance it is an amazing bag. i couldn't believe how much stuff i got in there on a recent trip. comfortable to wear with handy pockets and clips in all the right places. love this bag."
26,"Summarize: this case fits perfectly on my 14inch hp. i disagree with the comments that talk about the smell being terrible. the smell really wasn't that strong and went away after a couple of weeks. i love the design and it was a fair price. shipping was a little expensive though. it arrived quickly and i would buy from this seller again. this was bought for our teen daughter for christmas, the only negative things about it are <UNK> strap <UNK> pockets, other than that it is great, but in all fairness i knew both things about it when ordered, it came in very fast, was just as described, great item for the price. i have a dell inspiron 14, and the cover is a little snug. it's working well though and now i can carry my laptop in my school backpack rather than carry a separate laptop bag. i'd recommend this product, just do a bunch of research to make sure it will fit. i bought it for my acer 14 ', it is a little bit tight, but the worst was it has heavy rubber smell, when i leave the case in my room, the rubber smell was filled with the air everywhere of my room, made me sick. don't buy it. i like this case very much! it fits my acer aspire 14 'as a glove!!! yes, it smells a little bit but i wouldn't say that it's so bad as mentioned in some reviews. and it's very cute too. i recommend this product to anyone. love the design of this sleeve. when i don't have a table i use the sleeve as a mat to protect my thighs from the heat of my laptop. wish it had a bit more padding and cushion but other than that it's a pretty carrying sleeve. i really love it! it doesn't smell a lot as some reviews say and the draw is well <UNK> bought this size for a 13.3 'because my laptop will have a cover on it so i don't know how it fits for a traditional 14 inch, i really enjoy the design of this case but i thought it would be lighter. when it came, it was a very dark grey which was a bummer. but the quality is good and it has a nice thick padding to protect my laptop."
27,"Summarize: these insoles are so thin that i can even wear them in my pumps. they look so much nicer than <UNK> and work way better too. i highly recommend them. i accidentally ordered a men's 9 instead of a women's 9. it was huge but very easy to trim down with scissors. enjoy! i love this product... 100% natural and eliminates foot odor! while it appeared to be smaller than my 8.5 shoes, the insole fits perfectly into heels, boots, flats and running shoes. very impressed! it has worked wonders so far! can't wait to put this product to test this summer! product is ok. it doesn't seem to work as well for me as was advertised. it does serve to keep your show a little dryer, but doesn't seem to work all day for me. i wouldn't recommend it as there are other options that do the same but cost <UNK> this is a fantastic product that i would recommend to anyone who wants their feet to feel cooler, more comfortable, less sweaty and ultimately less smelly! they are so effective i use them in several pairs of shoes. i'm a very happy customer, thanks so much <UNK>! i have thick peeling, itchy skin on the bottom of one foot. i had tried everything to get rid of it. the final trick were these inserts along with slathering coconut oil mixed with athletes foot oil & oregano oil two times a day. finally, normal soft feet! got these for my 9-year-old who has really bad foot odor. i really had little confidence that these would work but needed to try <UNK> anything- to help. and lo and behold they actually work. so well that i ordered another set for a second pair of shoes. im sure if i were to put them in my tennis shoes they would probably fit perfectly. i am wearing them in my croc i have to wear for work. thay are to thin width wise to really make a difference bc they tend to slide around. the insoles fit comfortably into my shoes. i love that they are discreet and thin. i no longer have to worry about foot odor or about my shoes stinking. i definitely can see where my shoes will have a longer life by using these insoles."

29,"Summarize: cant give it 5 stars because the mounting screws that come with it are poor quality and will strip easily. do yourself a favor, head to the hardware store and get the # 6 - 32 1 'combination machine screws and throw out the ones that come with this product. the white trim screws are ok, but not great. good quality, everything that you need is included (except for the gang box of course). i'm using it with 16 awg wires (they say they are 14 but i know better than that). it should fit 14 and maybe even 12 awg. i'm not using banana jacks. easy installation and looking nice. much cheaper than brand product at local store. however, it doesn't look as nice as the brand ones either. i suspect the connectors are made of poorly gold-plated <UNK> or even other metal. but for my purpose and for the price, it is ok. cost much more from local retailers plus is a better product. some of the newer designs suck. plastic inserts don't try it if it says easier dont't buy it. this product works on old school. some times that's the best way. take a little longer to instal but no going back for loss wires all the screw heads were painted shut. i had to dig them all out before i could screw them in. the rest of the plate is ok but i didn't enjoy spending a bunch of time digging the slots out of the screws. i'd recommend going with something else. this is ok product. looks good and easy to <UNK>: cover is not a standard size and you probably wont be able to replace it. in addition it does not flush everything completely (not deep enough) and there is a small gap left between the wall and the plate. came individually packaged, with mounting screws. the backing plate is plastic, but sturdy enough. plastic is great for me as i live near the ocean and corrosion can happen. great quality. great price. much cheaper than local home improvement stores. bought five for my 5.1. installed into the boxes in the wall well. 4 stars for having a slight gap between the wall and the plate after install. i only notice it at slight angels. jacks are made well wires attached well."
30,"Summarize: i lived in sandals that looked exactly like this but i thought they were by bjorn. i couldn't find them anywhere, but found these (go figure). while they aren't quite as comfy as my other ones, i think with a bit of breaking in they'll be just fine. lots of compliments every time i wear them. not only are these super comfortable (yes, even between your toes), they look great with just about anything i wear! i have been complimented on these daily!! i typically wear a 6 1 / 2, i ordered a 7 and they fit perfect!! i need more of these!! highly recommended!! ! these thongs are fun, festive, flexible and surprisingly comfortable. i have very sensitive feet and i can wear these cuties all day. the arch support is great and there is a nice give in the sole. i love these so much i want to put a few pairs away in case they discontinue them. they go with everything. item was too small, purchased for a friend their size 9 is smaller than the size 8 in the store. sent it to the wrong address, and i can not seem to find anyone that will tell me where my bill is. i will never buy from white mountain again. this was great price for this cute sandal. unfortunately, the toe piece was very hard and they were a little narrow... unusual since i normally wear a b width. for the right person, they would probably be fine. they just didn't work for me. i get constant compliments on these sandals. i order them every summer in a variety of colors. i had heel spurs and back problems so the cushy softness of these is the only thing i can wear comfortably and the small wedge heel is perfect for my back. i have been wearing white mountain beaded sandals for a couple of years now and they are wonderful. they are lightweight and cushion the feet when worn for long hours. they are also beautiful and usually hold up for two or more seasons. i love white mountain <UNK> this is my 2nd pair of these shoes. i wore out the last pair after 2yrs. they are very very blingy and i like that. would i order another pair? you bet i would / will."
31,"Summarize: the box looked like it had been opened, and then re-taped for resell. one of the chairs was broken, and the broken piece was nowhere close to the originating piece. possibly other pieces damaged too, though didn't bother looking, instead just re-taped it back up to be sent back. i hope they don't just resell it to someone else. i love my new dining room set. the set is very sturdy, the walnut finish is a nice color.this set is great for a small area, kitchen <UNK> not recommend for a large eating <UNK> is small and so are the <UNK> strong enough to hold big boys and girls, thumps up, great price, packed well, arrived in a timely matter. the table and chairs are very nice but not quite the color i expected (but i am getting used to it). table and chairs delivered by the carrier right on time and with no damage. very easy to assemble, but very difficult to get out of the box it was so well protected. it fits perfectly in the kitchen at the office. my staff assembled it without any delay. everyone loves the dining set and they can't believe i ordered it on-line. i made the measurements and made sure of the dimensions of the room and the dining set and it's a perfect fit. it was easy to put together and looks great. however, when the item was shipped to me, one of the backs of the chairs was broken. i just fixed it myself with wood glue. its not even visible now. the rest of it was in perfect condition. moved to smaller living quarters and this just fits the bill. color is perfect and it was easy to assemble. one fault to find is that the top scratches easily. it even came with a scratch. other than that it is fine. i received this table and chairs completely damaged. the customer service experience with this company was terrible. in my opinion, this set is cheap and overpriced. it's not durable and not worth the money. don't waste your time. this table was super easy to put together. the table and chairs are solid and sturdy! the seats are very comfortable. the table is the perfect size for our not so big kitchen. we are very pleased with this purchase."
32,"Summarize: our photocopy machine jams often - the high humidity is a factor for that. we have placed the <UNK> <UNK> gel can on the photocopy tray that feeds the paper to the machine. the slender dimension allowed us to do that. so far, we've had fewer jams. i've also used a larger <UNK> desiccant in the cabinet where we store the paper. this dry pack as it's so called wouldn't even keep the humidity level in my small handgun safe down at an acceptable level, i even tried recharging it and it still did not work properly. i keep a electronic humidity monitor in my safe, and this dry pack would drop the humidity 1 or 2 percent from what it was without the pack. even though the humidity in the areas i used them ranges from 40% to 57%, the dry packs turned green much too quickly to be worth ordering more. i bought ten, and with a week or so, already some require 2 hours in the oven to dry out. way too much energy. i'll probably need a stationary <UNK>. my husband is a <UNK> and has a horse hoof that he uses in educating his clients. he has been using silica gel that he has pulled out of other packaging and so has not had a chance to evaluate this item. he likes the small size and the fact that it has an indicator on it. love this little unit. small enough to place in any container i chose and also 'rechargeable' by drying it out in an oven. color indicator is very helpful to determine if moisture contamination has occured. recommend for tropical zones and protecting valuable <UNK> or jewelry. nice quality for the case. little window is convenient for seeing color crystals. convenient shape for my purposes. works as well as any other brands i've had. case looks durable.i use these for protecting very expensive microphones i keep in sealed tupperware style cases. i put this in my safe because some things in it seemed to be 'soggy. i had to recharge it by baking it. the only this i would change was to buy a couple or get a bigger one to extract more water. i'm really not sure how good this is going to work. according to the instructions when the indicator turns green you are suppose to put it in the oven and dry it out. when i got mine the indicator was already mostly green."
33,"Summarize: i love the old style zippo but was having difficulty with the standard fluid and carrying the lighter around in my pocket. this made it very convenient and it's a cool 'novelty' item. i still keep most of my zippos original (standard insert), but it's cool to have a few of these with the 'butane' conversion kit... i think zippo over charges and i wanted to try off brand. i must say i have been pleasantly surprised and my wallet thanks me. don't get me wrong i love classic zippo lighters however butane torches are clean burning and are great for edc since they have almost zero odor. the torch also adjusts very nicely so you can fine tune your preference. thank god i found this. it works on butane, and it will hold fuel longer than a week. stupid zippo, with their flints, and their packing, and their wicks. they make a version of this with a flint, do not buy that one, buy this one. it works great. stay away form <UNK>. it did not fit properly. i then removed it and re-inserted original zippo insert. to my dismay, cap of zippo no longer closed properly. (apparently, attempting to get the thunderbird insert into the zippo and close the cap caused the hinge to deform, rendering the zippo unusable). disappointing, to say the least! i bought this product expecting it to last about a week, that was almost a year ago. i want to share just the facts: it plastic so don't go beating it <UNK> a little small so some tape is needed to build it up and hold it in <UNK> you clean it right it will last for a long time got for a christmas gift and i cant say how awsome this insert is i love that the fuel wont just evaporate the flames a bit big at first and had to urn screw as how the little lever wouldnt go over far enough but again no biggy awsome product i challenge you to blow this thing out i didn't know what to expect when i ordered this, but i am pleasantly pleased. the unit fits perfectly into my zippo case, and is easy to fill and use. once in a while it won't light but if you blow into the flame area it will work the next try. i like carrying my classic zippo and not <UNK> my cigars with lighter fluid. much cheaper to get a zippo and this insert than to buy a zippo blu. i also prefer the electric ignition to the flint wheel on the zippo blu."
34,"Summarize: we use it in our office to tell another employee if they have a call on hold, but that is about all it is good for. don't bother trying to have a conversation, clarity is too poor. i didn't realize until after the fact that i should have just bought walkie talkies. at least battery life in these are good. the units work fine and the setup is described in the manual works well. the one thing that my wife and i do not like is the audio. sounds like you are in a box. the calling button is also a bit strange. it first beeps and then you can speak. the distance it covers is very good. don't waste your money on these. although if you try hard enough you can make out what the other person is saying, the audio quality is extremely poor, as is the noise cancellation (if any), and the general sound quality. i wish i had saved the boxes. i'd be sending these back. and the problem is having to wake the kids up in the morning to go to school. they are upstairs and i used to have to trek up and down a couple of times each morning. we put one in each bedroom, 1 in the living room and 1 in the study. problem solved. i searched extensively for an intercom for my large two floor home. i selected this unit (ordering three units) and regret my decision. it was very difficult set up and doesnot work that well. i wish i could get a refund as we never use it. my search continues. took a long time to get and when i finally got them, they didn't seem to work to well joined up (i have 3). also, they should have come with dc chargers, they don't seem to work well with batteries, imho. it is simple to program and operate, which is just what i was looking for. i just wish i didn't have to buy a power cord separately. i am running it on batteries right now, but i am not sure how long they will last. i've spent hours already trying to set up my network and get this system going. the engineering leaves much to be desired. can't get it to work as advertised. the manual is one of the least helpful such documents i've ever seen."
35,"Summarize: amazon ought to be ashamed to carry this junk on their line-up. you got enough bad reviews to open your <UNK> reading the murdered english in their manual is enough to tell you this is made by <UNK>. just try <UNK> to your station on the fm - hopeless. the noisy constant fan! the unreal low price should have been a <UNK>! charles i did not go wrong when i purchased this stereo receiver. tons of power pushing my system, what an upgrade from my old one, this is a real powerhouse. it pounds. remote control, quality crafted stereo receiver for under a hundred bucks! i thought it would be good, but did not expect this. a sweet deal! if you want just a stereo then this will do the manual is very limited. the fan is loud and the usb player will only let you go one track at a time so if you have a 100 tracks it will take time to get there. the sound is fine and is easy to connect up. first problem i have with this receiver is you can't set the channel presets. also the speaker wire terminals are not clamps and it took me a while to screw them in. the power is good and it looks durable. i don't believe you can play the tv's sound through the receiver. i got this to replace a 20 year old stereo i had. i went by the speaker specifications when i purchased this one. when i hooked it up, this receiver pushed my 15's more than i ever heard before without messing them up. perfection!! i recommend this to everyone! this amp is very inexpensive and its performance proves its quality. first, you can't play a turntable without buying a preamp. that would be ok if the sound reproduction was good. i would have settled for good. i didn't settle and returned it; you shouldn't either. this sound system is worth all the money you pay for it iv never heard bass so clear and ass loud as its going tough my 12 '' and 8 '' and two 5 '' subwoofers buy this if your looking for grate sound. the stereo works fantastic as amp. for laptop or mp3 player. radio reception is poor. has great range of sound adjustment. i have it in my garage, with speakers all around. use mostly for sirius / xm radio on laptop."
