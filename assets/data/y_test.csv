0,This is a really cute hat that even folds well for easy packing. It is large enough to protect my face and my hair from the sun with UV protection. I received many compliments on this hat. It fits well on stays on nicely at the beach and it made me fee so much cooler on a hot day.
1,"Women's tank top fits well, runs a little small, but of good quality. It's a thin weight tank, great for layering. It comes in many colors. The only negative is that it's listed as long, but is actually a very standard length. If you want a regular, basic tank top, this is it."
2,This is a beautiful kettle even though it appears smaller and the color is a little off from the ads and it may seem a bit smaller  but otherwise it looks very nice. Something to keep in mind of though is the handle seems unable to handle too much heat as it is can melt easier than you'd think.
3,Exactly as described. Looks good with a solid build and the unit is quite sturdy. This unit locks in very tightly and also feels professional. It is a great purchase for the money. I'd recommend this handle highly.
4,"This poster is great for teaching children about the solar system. It is informative and easy to understand. It does not come with a frame. The quality is not the best and may be difficult to read from far away. Overall, I recommend the poster despite the quality because the price is very low."
5,"This purse is well-designed in terms of appearance, but not in terms of usability and reliability. It is smaller than advertised, the straps are flimsy, and the decorations fall off very easily. It works well if you're just looking for a fashion statement, but if you want something practical, I'd look elsewhere."
6,"""This is the perfect """"comfy shoe,"""" great for walking around town or casual get togethers. Cute and functional! They do run a bit big, plan to order them 1/2-1 size smaller than usual. Another very comfortable shoe by Ahnu, would definitely buy again!"""
7,"This case is a very dark color. It has a good amount of padding. The fit is good on my 14 inch laptop. It has a smell that slowly goes away. Shipping was quick but a little expensive. I would recommend this to others, this product is just as described."
8,"This is a good monitor, it is easy to use and well-made. The product is for you, if you are in need of a heart rate monitor. It is fairly accurate and warns you should in case you fall out of a target heart range. The battery is not replaceable and screen easily scratches."
9,"Using the Omega 3 Fish oil tablets will  give you a great blueprint for better health. Imagine not having to take the medicine and then burping afterwards, this burp- less version does this. I have it on auto ship and love not ever missing a dose or having to look for it in the stores."
10,"These NuGo bars are fantastic and taste great like a Rice Krispy treat. Good for morning, lunch or afternoon snack and a good way to get your protein in-take. They keep you full for a long time especially if you are out and about. I keep one in my purse to eat on the go."
11,"This chicken roaster works both in the oven and on the grill. It's a great way to cook a whole chicken and has a pan underneath to catch all the drippings. It can be used with a beer can or without, and holds a large chicken. It's a little tall, so it may not work in all ovens and barbecue grills."
12,"You get what you pay for with this receiver. Terrible radio reception, very noisy fan, and don't expect any help from the useless manual. It does have decent power, but I'd rather pay a bit more for a quality product."
13,"I bought these because I know that these filters are the ones I need. I've bought them before, but Amazon repeatedly tells me that I need a different filter. I think their Bought Together section is messed up, so don't buy this filter just because Amazon says to. Anyways, these filters have always worked well for me."
14,"These are silver discs, not the gold ones as advertised. The packaging is not good, they need to be packed more securely, the DVDs shouldn't be able to slide around. The quality of the DVDs is hit or miss. You might have a good batch and then run into several that won't work."
15,Purse looks great. The bag is cute and flashy but the size is smaller than expected overall. The stones and straps are not very durable and break or fall off easily.
16,"overall impression of the product is negative. in some cases it works nicely, but the settings are confusing to adjust, sometimes it is not clear if they do anything at all. product is not worth the money that it costs, it better to avoid it."
17,"These odor-absorbing insoles work very well! The thin insoles fit well into many kinds of footwear and they are also easy to trim down if they are too large. They help to absorb odor and wetness all day. , and may even extend the life of my shoes."
18,"These pills will do the job, that's if you get to use them long enough to notice they are working. The label on the bottle doesn't state this, however, if you do not keep these pills in the original bottle with the drying agent, they will bust and turn into powder making them unusable."
19,This GPS is easy to use and fairly inexpensive. As a backup unit it is nice to have but sometimes the map is not up to date and you will end up on a different route than intended. There is also a bug where the battery drains due to the GPS unit waking itself up and is an unresolved issue. This of course does not mean every unit is affected by this. It is easy to use and works great when there are no issues. For the price and accessibility it is recommended but with caution.
20,"I think this supplement is great. It is a very good value for the price. I do highly recommend that you store them in the original container, because humidity it definitely not it's friend. I have followed the instructions exactly, and it has done wonders for me. There are many brands that are more expensive, but this brand is just as good, if not better."
21,"This product is innovative and works! It keeps your glasses with you and the strong magnet lasts. Everyone that I've shown this to decides that they need one too. The only problems are that the small pieces can occasionally fall off, and the glasses don't always stay if you bend over. Otherwise, this is a great product that is especially useful if you tend to misplace your glasses."
22,"""Before purchasing this product, I highly suggest checking your vaccumn to see what type of filters will fit. Amazon lists this product with several cyclone vaccumns under the """"commonly purchased together"""" section and that is not correct. This filter wilk not work in just any cyclone vaccumn. If this fliter actually fits in your vaccumn, its a great product and will last a long time if you take care of it and rinse it off occassionally."""
23,"This bag is lightweight yet very roomy. It has plenty of pockets for storage and organization. The safety feature makes it perfect for traveling although you need to keep the contents light to use as a cross bag. It comes in black, blue and mauve although the mauve looks like more of a purple."
24,What an impressive Thomas the Train costume! It will fit any train loving toddler for at least a few Halloween seasons due to its roomy design. The candy pocket on the front is an adorable touch. And it's so stinkin' cute! Absolutely worth the price.
25,"A really great quality vacuum from Miele such a good product. Really handy to use around the house on rugs, carpet or hardwood floors and its lightweight. It was a little pricey but what is price when it does a good job. Also its really quiet as well. I give it a thumbs up."
26,"If you are looking for a basic intercom system and nothing fancy, then this product is for you. It is perfect for what I need it for. They do not come with cords, so make sure you have batteries. It has a good range of coverage. All units work well, and the setup was easy as described in the manual. They are simple to use and my kids love them! Great product for the price."
27,"The hat is comfortable, stylish and easy to pack into a suitcase for travel. It protects well from the sun, keeps the head cool, and is suitable for both boat trips and more dressy occasions. Sizing is 'one size fits all' which seems to be good on even large heads. The customer service was great, ensuring the product arrived on time before travelling."
28,"These hooks are decent for hanging up very small things. Common household essentials such as oven mittens or kitchen towels are possible to hang up, but give a hassle with the hook sliding down. The magnets attach to the hooks are too small to handle many things, but are pretty strong for it's size."
29,"This Miele vacuum is wonderful at sucking up dirt. It is quiet, and easy to use. The price is a bit higher than other vacuums on the market but the quality of the product is reflected in its price. This is a bagged vacuum, so there is an added expense of the bags to be factored in."
30,"These acupressure mats are used to increase circulation and reduce body aches and pains and are most effective when you can fully relax. Consistence is key to receive the full, relaxing benefits of the product. However, if you are using this product after surgery it is responsible to always consult with your physician to ensure it is right for your situation."
31,"Overall a great gps for the price, simple and easy to use. Makes a great gift for those not comfortable using a smartphone. May not keep up with the latest map updates, especially in a big city, so keep that in mind when using."
32,"while there are some products that may be cheaper and seem like they might work better short term, but the Oxo Good Grips Julienne peeler is a great tool in the kitchen as is durable for the long haul.. while it is extremely sharp, the shield provide excellent safety and support for your hand. All in all this is an excellent assistance to using a knife. Buy this soon"
33,"I love these cleaners, it does a great job and it's easy to use. I like that they are disposable. They scrub very well, no touching required and the refills are wonderful. It is well worth the money."
34,"This 14' laptop sleeve has an attractive design and is made of quality materials. It has a very snug fit, so be cautious of buying it if your laptop is even slightly over 14'. The only real issue is the rubbery smell that comes with it. Overall, I would recommend this, unless you have a sensitive nose."
35,"These Dansko shoes are amazingly comfortable and hug the shape of my feet well, but I did have to wear them for a bit to stretch them out. They felt a little tight at first, but now they are perfect. I feel they're true to size so I'd recommend ordering these in your normal shoe size."
