1,"These boots are great, excellent quality, incredibly comfortable and the sizes are exact. It's a little expensive, but will last me for about twenty years. The shipping was fast, two days. I love it."
2,"This solar charger works well at first and charges phones well but does not adequately charge iPads or Kindles. The LED flashlight is quite bright. Performance over time is not reliable as the charge battery begins to not hold charge. A battery charge level indicator would be helpful. Overall, a decent purchase for a backup or travel."
3,"This little unit is efficient for smaller environments that aren't overly  humid. If you have a large safe or super damp space, this might not be the most practical option. The case is durable, and I like that there's a green indicator light that tells you when you need to dry it in the oven. I'd recommend it for a jewelry box, smaller weapons safe, or a cabinet with documents."
4,"This charges our phones with no problem, but we haven't been able to get a full charge on a tablet out of it so far. It's great for hiking and camping since there is a nice bright flashlight incorporated into it. I wouldn't trust it as your only charging source during a power outage if there is no sun. If the sun is shining, you'll be fine since it can use solar energy to charge. You can also charge it quickly with electricity, if you prefer."
5,"Great value machine. After a few trial runs, you can make the perfect tortilla. It can also make an array of other edibles such as crepes and pizza crusts. It is not so good for dough that requires air pockets as it is a press, but for tortillas, it's great. Customer service is very responsive and helpful."
6,"If you are a beginning photographer and wan good pictures i suggest buying this Nikon camera. it does not come with an sd card which is not cool for the money i spent and they can be pretty pricey. If you need low light capability on your camera , than this is the one for you it seems to have a feature for every scene or situation"
7,"I love the look of these shoes, and everyone in my walking group has commented on how great they look! I took the advice of others and ordered a size smaller. They fit just right and are very comfortable. I walk for two hours, 4 times a week, and these shoes have been just what I need."
8,"These swim trunks look great and the waist fits as expected for the size. They are also a good deal for the price. However, the inner mesh liner is much smaller than the size of the outer trunks. You will probably have to cut out the mesh liner to wear them comfortably."
9,These are nice fitting shorts but the mesh liner felt tight and I cut it out. You might want to size up if you are unsure. The deep pockets come in handy. These shorts are stylish and they look good. They are more comfortable if the inner mesh liner is removed.
10,"This necklace is beautiful and well-made for the price. Even though the chain is thin it hasn't broken. The pendant is really nice, but it is hard to tell the size from the photos. It would look great around the neck of any woman you get it for!"
11,"This is a nice little julienne peeler, it does a fantastic job when making zucchini noodles or slicing carrots. It is not as effective for fruit, which gets stuck and makes it hard to keep slicing. It's VERY sharp, watch your fingers! Overall, this Oxo has a comfortable grip and is a great deal."
12,"Can be a little pricey at $3.80 per bar, but these NuGo bars offer a low calorie, low glycemic index snack that is healthy and still taste great. Taste is reminiscent of Rice Krispie treats, especially the variety with vanilla frosting. Some stores don't carry these bars, but they are available easily online."
13,"This kitchen steamer is based on a classic design, works very well and is convenient to use. It can steam a variety of foods, from vegetables and starches, to seafood and eggs. It's rather large, which can be an issue if your counter space is limited. Overall, highly recommended."
14,"This purse is pretty and the material looks great! Unfortunately, it is smaller than I hoped and a few of the straps have fallen off. So have a couple of the stones. I wish it had stayed together because I would have loved to use it more."
15,"I've always used HP DVD + R discs, but these are silver instead of the gold they used to be. These silver ones are hit or miss. I'll burn 10 DVDs no problem, then get a few coaster in a row. I wish the gold DVD + R were still around. I'm glad I bought the 100 pack in case I have any other issues."
16,If you love steamed veggies this is the dream steamer you should have at home. The steamer takes less space in kitchen and very quick to steam all kind of veggies. Very easy to to use and easy to clean. It will steam veggies for a serving for two people at a time.
17,"This steamer is perfect for someone cooking a single serving for themselves. Anyone cooking for anyone other than themselves, however, will probably not enjoy this product as it is very small and only cooks a small portion at a time. Also, it is made of silicone so the flimsy material causes spills if you are not careful and it is very hot when you pull it out of the microwave."
18,This hat looks great and does the job! The one siz fits all really does fit and the stitching design looks great while protecting your head and neck from the sun's UV rays. It also can be rolled up and packed without messing up the hat as it unrolls and still looks great! Just make sure you hang on to it if your on a boat so it doesn't blow off your head! This is definitely a product you wont want to lose!
19,"The BulkSupplements Pure Magnesium Citrate Powder is a unique product in its own right. as it does dissolve well, it has a lot of health benefits such as calming down , arthritis. as it comes in a liuid form i prefer the powder for some weird reason. With it being so affordable, ordering this in a large amount is preferred for me and lastly with it being so  concentrated it can last for a long time"
20,This product is a great addition to any kitchen! The color is fantastic and it's sturdy build is perfect for holding as many kitchen utensils as it does! It holds a lot of utensils without being too big and bulky so it fits nicely on the kitchen cabinet. Definitely would recommend for any kitchen!
21,"very good heart monitor if you don't need advanced features, that would be used mainly by professionals. very easy use. the drawbacks are, bad or no included manual, but manual is accessible on the internet. and only four digits on the display, so if you run more than an hour that could be an issue. overall recommended"
22,"This camera is easy to use and you can take it anywhere. The picture quality is generally great. Some things to note are that it does not include an SD card and there have been instances of issues regarding the on / off button, they can seem a little small. It also holds it's own against more expensive cameras. Overall this small but easy to use camera takes great pictures so it is recommended with confidence."
23,"Nice, lightweight, comfortable shoes for casual use like walking- if they fit you well. Sizing is confusing, tends to run large and not fit well on wider feet. Expect to need 1/2 size to 1 full size smaller than your normal shoe size. Try these on in person if possible!"
24,"a good product, compares to the original very good, for the fraction of the size. very convenient when traveling or living in the dorm, since the space is an issue there. there was no power cord, so that should be kept in mind. much better than nose generating apps."
25,"I love this bag! It was exactly what I needed for my trip to Europe. It has all the pockets I could ever need, and I was able to fit my phone, camera, snacks, maps, a guidebook AND my Kindle, plus everything else I would normally carry while still being comfortable. The color seems a bit different than I remember, but overall it looks great."
26,"This case fits so snug around my 14 inch laptop. The quality if very good with draw being well defined. There is a hint of a rubber odor that may be a turn off for some, but the smell goes away rather quickly. A great buy for the price."
27,"While they are a little thin which can be an issue, the Insoles work really well at keeping odor away and fits really well in most shoes. While cheaper ones do exist on the market, these ones have been great at battling the issues i had before using these insoles."
28,"this magnesium supplement is very good for the money. helps to improve the mood, to make sleep better. the price is a better deal than the competitor products. especially if you buy in bulk. one thing, it does not taste like a CALM product, so you should keep that in mind. recommended."
29,"This is easy to install, and comes with everything you need. However, the mounting screws aren't great quality and it might be best to replace with something else. It's much cheaper than branded products, but as it isn't a standard size, the fit might not be good on some walls."
30,"These sandals are both very comfortable AND very stylish! They do run a bit small, so you may want to order 1 size up. Overall, a great shoe that you'll enjoy, even after a couple years of consistent use! HIGHLY recommend White Mountain sandals."
31,Good deal on these tables and chairs! May come in separate packages but they will be well protected. Color may vary from what you see on the website so be aware. Easy assembly. Seems durable enough. Great option for a small living space.
32,"It did not work properly, the photocopy machine jams often. But the case looks durable and the unit is quite small to fit in any container of my choosing. It is also rechargeable by using an oven to dry it out."
33,"Great insert for the price, works well with my Zippo case. It uses butane, which is cleaner burning as well as convenient. Thunderbird is a fantastic alternative to the more pricey Zippo inserts. It holds a big flame, too, and it's easily adjustable."
34,"This does not come with an AC charger so you have to use batteries or buy a cord separately. I think this covers a good distance and the battery life seems good. The audio is not great, it is not very clear. It is challenging to set up. Walkie talkies would work about as well."
35,"This is an inexpensive stereo option. The manual is limited and is difficult to read, also the fan is loud. The radio reception is poor quality. The sound quality though is great, when listening to Sirius or when hooked up to a laptop."
